wrawv2oo68,42,excellent pov bw processing brings the various textures in this out beautifully.

tbb3xxmama,45,good processing to bring out the detail in the bricks. good colours.
x5snabijm5,46,would like to know where this is im in colorado and i know its not that far. it looks really good in black and white.
x5snabijm5,47,"holy cripe, thats awesome! your use of black and white is to remarkable effect here. bumping this to a and making a fave. too incredible."
x5snabijm5,48,id like to see this in colour. i think it would give the building more prominence.
a6pt67mw5f,49,"gorgeous! even though this photo is black and white i still get the beachy, hot feel!"

45wy3pxh4q,55,i love the play of light and shadow in this image.
45wy3pxh4q,56,great effect the way the light coming from behind creates here.
wa2s2jd45g,57,"quality of photo gorgeous, great job."
yuyu29gj5s,58,"okay, i think i can like this. the garish colors are just too much fun."
yuyu29gj5s,59,"not sure i like the use of colors here and, more important, this harsh contrast between vivid colors is working against the idea of years old"
d6nzojm6fi,60,"im really surprised this did so poorly. got a from me, i think its absolutely excellent. good to see your trip paid off with such a quality image."
d6nzojm6fi,61,photogood job the black and white photo helps with the age idea
0lzhzhm5kj,62,the way the lines run across it almost looks like a huge orange
xram0n5vjj,63,idea is very good we still pollute and mess around with years old plants. presenatation is also very good cloud just stands out. main building though doesnt look years old probably renovated
vc0hmijr53,64,looks a little odd. not sure if this is an intentional treatment or not.
gk8jhv2ot9,65,wow! precious collection! the image quality is great.

g3bqeh0xo4,71,i love the texture the color and the action of this piece great work.
prhis6osaw,72,i love the darkness but honestly i could use just a bit more detail. its a cool design.
d3fogpxy7t,73,"too much blur for my taste, but a great mood here."

byj54vj5t8,91,"i like the color contrasts, with distinct zones of black, white and green."
dqly5n4oap,92,"the selective desat would have been fine, but the beaks are a bit too saturated."
dqly5n4oap,93,a tad overexposed. have you boosted the colour saturation? the swans bills look a little unnatural.
12pe6fjq99,94,gotta love scandals. i love this unique idea. good job.
12pe6fjq99,95,theyre just jealous of those gorgeous yellow legs.
ko2e2iaahq,96,very unique! i like the different angles of the rings. the contrast of light and dark is wonderful.
kdi6m7l8e4,97,"i really like the sharpness of this photo, and the humour that goes with it"

n9svrgrjka,106,now theres a look you dont see every day. interesting placement and colors.
xermyvq1sl,107,nice photo. i think i would have prefered less of the actual shadow. the metaphorical one works though!
wrbt0nvt9m,108,hahhaha this is great.like the bright flash and color.
wrbt0nvt9m,109,groovy dude! would like to see the fro and the peace sign a bit sharper.
vr6rdbjs1h,110,"a bit too dark, othervice ok."
xvv020aihk,111,"you have maneged to capture the photos on the page sharply, which is something i find difficult."
hxf0nkuzku,112,"over and underexposed at the same time imo, maybe!"
odxniu186x,113,oakley glasses in ? maybe some green rayban would have fit better.
gtyvpy4zpb,114,very cold war mood to this one. like the angles.
49bhp8dy1r,115,"i have no doubt this will get totally hammered but i understand exactly what you are doing and i appreciate it. i hope this does better than i predict it will, its quite original and it took guts to enter such a totally blurred image."
fiue6ux8pw,116,i guess there is someone. its too dark! s
vfpkcka1qq,117,a bit too dark and the whote balance seems off.
2inxzcpe87,118,i love the colors! amazing colors i love them. its obviously green. the perfect color!
2inxzcpe87,119,good colorful photo. good job!
74w0d2ra3t,120,"oh, wow! too bad its not a little brighter with all these colors. still, a great find!"
jx11dyq08w,121,warm memories are depicted here so attractively good light as well.
nlswdaho4u,122,"now thats a kwel vinyl! i have a white one, but nothing like this!"
a1gs0soxei,123,the black and white for me is also reflective of the ideologies of the day. as most folks on both sides of the issue viewed things in black and white terms only.
y6z5raeihm,124,the movement is suffering a bit from the little blast of light.
md0xgpqshl,125,wheres the joint? lol.good job here.nice work with all the detail. and costumes
3ytps6o51v,126,"cool shadows, but alittlebit too much grey"
cp2p8chain,127,i was probably too tired when i was writing about what i did to the photo. i did not desat all colors but red ! but rather all colors but blue. if you did not notice already
irzmfo430q,128,"the grain does wonders for this photo and its period, though it seems a touch flat."
irzmfo430q,129,black white works well with the poster. well done.
r6k567yjqw,130,thats a cool effect. how did you get that broad white line? the colour is great. . even though the climax of the cold war was rather in the sixties.
s3z3glcukp,131,"a bit overexposed, but im assume you intended that."
ox0jmymphf,132,"would be better with more lightning, but i guess then it would also look more after christ again! p"
ox0jmymphf,133,"this one definitely give me the chills. good exposure, i like the creepy, coming to getcha feeling it gives."
3iwlt530rl,134,its got a retro feel but didnt photographers know about white balance even in the s? lol
8nn9okg8a1,135,"hmm. i think this is the only picture that could be taken at that time if they had yellow signs in that time, not sure."
wvbolkyd77,136,you have to have really good photographic skills to blur something this clearly!
zy9ti01r9w,137,wow! nice picture.that would make a great poster. the light effectgreat!
zevabv0ymo,138,i like this because you are showing present day photo quality with an glimps of the past. we all know that it wasnt grainy and black and white in the s. just the pictures were.
vntdyfd6tr,139,quite a bit of separation in the hues of color.
707nasqpjm,140,love the graininess of this it is typical of the era
7ljode35l4,141,color thing just didnt work for me sorry
b7dv10p7xe,142,good old zenit i had one of those or should i say my dad had one. good choice of bw here.
t2ygm1rifc,143,could be even more red and magenta to make it look like straight from the s photoalbum.
t2ygm1rifc,144,great colour tone. makes what could have been a flat image jump a bit.
t2ygm1rifc,145,i like the colors in this shot.kind of glad you didnt go bw. i think this works well.
eo61y1xhal,146,"beautiful! great colours! orange, green blue!"
fa22pfemvq,147,"just guessing, early s model convertible. good job capturing the red."
iqq8cta6f5,148,made me laugh. captures the era alright. like the way the light hits on the chains.
h6uqgsibls,149,"those burned matchheads have a pretty interesting texture, somewhat akin to furry brains, whatever that means."
kn465cgtnr,150,interesting choice of duotone color.
us0wx8ia2i,151,fabulous image. masterful given the fixed nature of the exposure time.
lcvrubl17y,152,"nice tones, very good contrast, perfect, classy model."
t2c7o2mvo9,153,"overprocessed imho, colors are good, but sometimes too overpowering."
uem9zmqjxd,154,i like the blue tones offset by the yellow towers. i bet it was really peaceful out there and really
caf2hqfbef,155,good exposure nice flaring of lights
s2vd5lwp58,156,i really like this really gritty image which works really well and makes full use of the s exposure time.
ibwrv9zybv,157,perfect sharpness and light on the veggies.
wp39lkvkcj,158,gogeous i bet itd look nice in a grayscale too!
o2gz7vckkt,159,"nice colors and lines, but not a great demo of a second exposure."
5829z8xfjt,160,awesome b and w conversion.i love the contrast
5829z8xfjt,161,the choice of black and white is clever and makes the hard shadows very aesthetic. perfect!
5829z8xfjt,162,a real banker well executed and bw is a great choice
5829z8xfjt,163,this is very brautiful. the texture of the waves makes the photo seem like they are crashing and splashing all over the place.
51fudlw22a,164,very nice.impressive use of motion.
s51d4qhxej,165,lovely motion and drama.
1mvlr9mxnt,166,really moody. almost has a scary quality too. i like it.
qi1qll72y3,167,"great color contrast, perfect balance within the picture. just love it."
ldekrpyouy,168,"i really like the processing, michelle. good bw, too."
ldekrpyouy,169,i like the use of the duo tone on this one.
ldekrpyouy,170,i really like the nice grainy look to this one! definatly gives that old time feel.
xgprcqzv8h,171,love the lines and the effect and the color great job!
xgprcqzv8h,172,i love the curves and color. very nice picture.
i0my19zf1x,173,interesting capture. color tones are wonderful.
f67fcugwjd,174,this is awesome! love the colors and the streaks. how in the heck did you do that?
owcl8bu23w,175,you should have stuck an mini light on the edge of the record to get a psychedelic lookof course that has nothing to do with jazz. sorry
o6hzkw4jgj,176,"pretty flowers, and very clean and sharp."
o6hzkw4jgj,177,"decent image, but nothing typical of a second exposure"
88wa3ty7ko,178,nice use of time and motion and color
pfihdmk7iw,179,goofy and fun. i like the detail of the lines on the decking.
btzqc9s3rb,180,i thought this would be the blue winner.awesome exposure
3pkm95tjgd,181,excellent tones and texture. nice light to.
bt2z9a7p5q,182,this must be enzos. fantastic choice of the selective desat.
bt2z9a7p5q,183,"nicely exposed, i guess you used some sort of filter to lengthen the exposure? im not sure about the selective desat."
bt2z9a7p5q,184,oh thats terrific but not sure of the selective desat.
qvk007xlwm,185,ha ha. neat trick. your model did well to stay still.
tu8gt7e4ey,186,"ok, its growing on me. not a classic portrait, but a well done candid portrait. mia? this yours?"
fyjjmah8p0,187,yes! i wouldnt want to change a thing. the colour scheme is stunning. my choice for blue.
fyjjmah8p0,188,this is really lovely the choice of sepia is a good one. well done
60segeict5,189,im not sure if sepia really did anything for the photo
66jyfln433,190,"something very warm and innocent about this, love the comp. color and detail."
v4rstgo788,191,always good to see an image of such obvious quality.
v4rstgo788,192,beautiful the models too. i really like the tones in this good choice of black white.
4tyou6wyyi,193,"image, adjustments, photo filter, warming filter set to and preserve luminosity selected."
4tyou6wyyi,194,facial tones were a bit flat in my opinion and could use a little bump. not much and is very minimal really.
11u6t5mvdw,195,"very avantgarde, somewhat disturbing image. it wants to say something to me, but i dont understand, which is something to watch with challenging images. dont let your creativity obscure your message."
x944y1sn71,196,"i lovely sentimental photo, not sure about the use of grain here though."
x944y1sn71,197,thr grain doesnt work to me
x944y1sn71,198,dont know if grainy effect was on purpose but not working for me im afraid
dnhwt1erpp,199,"whoo hoo. see i told you, you wold at least get the yellow."
gjgqsnicuh,200,"great colors, great contrast, great expressions. great picture."
a6c92ncljy,201,"radiant and warm, just wonderful"
a6c92ncljy,202,adorable. theyre very cute wonderful choice of bw the tones are excellent.
q5c3sz4ghq,203,very nice image. i would have liked to have seen more light on the darker sides of their faces.
ljk5ku4xto,204,"wow very powerful image i like it a lot, very nice choice with color."
76plj211sk,205,really fun portrait! these two ladies look like they are having a blast. i like the color pink splash from the boas
76plj211sk,206,love the funkyness! great colors!
76plj211sk,207,"thelma and louise, watch out. great colors and quite funny."
e1eqhvyrpr,208,wonderful color! love the expressions and freckles!
8di1dcokxv,209,"great capture, good detail and comp."
t5mwkoq20f,210,seated girls portrait is nice. standing one is awkward and not complimentary to the photo as a whole. nice colors.
58hjp6qjdg,211,very national geographicesque. contrast is pretty good.
58hjp6qjdg,212,"i really like this, lots of impact, great colors and detail."
ngb2rpjtuo,213,nice composure but exposure looks a little flat
3s761gs43w,214,"very nice, love the boys look and the grandfather is a classic"
wro4jftblk,215,this doesnt give the most flattering light but you may be going for a particular look
wro4jftblk,216,the light and the sharpening strike me as too harsh
l2yt48iuaf,217,the processing is noisy or has artifacts or something maybe heavy sharpening followed by heavy noise reduction? not sure. great capture though.
8l1akgpugm,218,"excellent use of available light, tones are gorgeous, too!"
8l1akgpugm,219,"love the candid feel, bw is perfect here and great light."
tsmnikrcpk,220,very unique picture. i like the black and white and the clarity is great. this could easily be on an advertisement for v
m75jys1og7,221,i like the contrast and sharpness. good job.
m75jys1og7,222,which wins out? great light and detail. bw conversion works very well.
qk0d90bjir,223,"nice capture. it looks like it could benefit from a levels adjustment, andor a color balance. it seems a little dim and with a bluish overcast."
30exdzwil5,224,beautifu colors and wonderfully lit.
30exdzwil5,225,i like the colors and soft feel which is odd since its a lot of hard rocks. good job.
o5e2bi1kw2,226,feels like a fairy tale. nice capture. just seems a bit underexposed.
31bkfvk7di,227,fun idea. nicely done. the selective desat works well.
x4bas98882,228,"technically brillant, telling at least for a musician, and a bright idea!"
d0uwiza31q,229,"good potential, but a bit overexposed and lacking in contrast."
gjj8hsgda8,230,a little distracted by the wear on the outer dial.
61dqsj7wcn,231,wonderful sharp grittiness to this shot.well done
3u2d6hngjv,232,very interesting.nice show of the second exposure.
3u2d6hngjv,233,that is a good idea. original with an abstractlike quality.
crk70rr19m,234,"holly crap! absolutely stunning photo, my pic for the blue hands down!"
ua52qyedn5,235,wow lovely red streams!
fhigl17h65,236,this is neat. looks like something from an advertisement. great job!
e03j0wad6j,237,do you have any hot stock tips? by the looks of the page you chose to burn you have some gains to declare.
ollzebvpyl,238,this is fantastic. a daytime exposure that worked. nice job!
ollzebvpyl,239,"good idea, but maybe taken in the evening or with a filter would allow some details."
0tr6qzwpjs,240,i like the shift in color from deep red to light orange.
1bsk2n4qtd,241,"kinda blurry, but kinda not. artistic rendering. ."
2vvkv0n2n8,242,"great, eerie colors and tone."
lwrbfarqh4,243,this was my choice for a blue. very nice gary you got my .
lwrbfarqh4,244,"beautiful colours and textures, light and shadows."
ayi46d0yeh,245,i guess im not the only one to tell you to use less compression. the otherwise promising looking picture is incredibly pixelated or was that intentional?
ayi46d0yeh,246,"hmm. not sure what happened here, but there are tons of jpeg artifacts and you can barely see any detail of the image."
ijpujjvxpi,247,like the black and white effect!suits it well
opvuwv6pgn,248,hot! .or not. abit unsharp.
8gluuv3lk7,249,"i think the idea is nice, but the picture itself isnt super. it looks flat."
l5a1zpew58,250,"a nice idea, but a little blurry, otherwise this would have been really good instead of fairly good."
ouayfax79u,251,a tad more contrast for shadow dencity wouldve been a great touch to this image.
zq87nvogxg,252,interesting image. the grain ads a lot of character to it.
iem4vruim3,253,"nice picture, but theres nothing there to demonstrate the idea of a second exposure."
iem4vruim3,254,this may be a second exposure but it doesnt seem relevant.
iem4vruim3,255,"great bright colors, and a very clear, sharp, image as well."
6urevcson6,256,beautifully done! such amazing sharpness and detail. i love this photo!
zap7ppfgz4,257,"very nice contrast in color nice clarity, crispness."
98aktbq2gb,258,very nice softness to falls through sec exposure. highlight blown slightly.
hirr6qihiu,259,that touch of red is a nice touch! well done
9514ymvntq,260,interesting effect. hope you share it. love the colors
180urkgy6p,261,i like this even if it looks like a multiple exposure rather than seconds.
ad8aph1fsp,262,incredibly rich tones and colors. very nice job of taking something rahter ugly and making it appear beautiful. excellent!
ad8aph1fsp,263,great detail and sharpness in this pic.
4nwyuzj4ei,264,this has nice visual appeal. well done black and white?i think.
4nwyuzj4ei,265,"exquisite image, though how can i see seconds worth of exposure, ."
4nwyuzj4ei,266,the image is striking. nice movement even with no movement!
6x9dp1wiot,267,"of the blurry clocks presented here, i think that this one is the best one. good job"
g3zdlhd9l6,268,i like the rich look of this photo. vivid color.
g3zdlhd9l6,269,oh how gorgeous! perfect exposure. nothing blown out. everything clear and sharp. fantastic job! i want to go there!
zu42wt59kq,270,"amazing image. as it look like a ghost in the image, re the use of the second exposure. i really like this, and i also give it the wow factor as well."
2ja7s1a93q,271,"great image, excellent light play"
31apl50sry,272,"i know the clouds would have movced due to the exposure time, but it doesnt add much to the picture in my opinion."
31apl50sry,273,nice colors. i would not expect clouds to be this fuzzy from a twosecond exposure.
fezy5kth1t,274,nice saturation of colour and the whole thing looks nice.
fezy5kth1t,275,"im not sure if this was handheld or is intentionally fuzzy, but its a bit hard to look at because of the motion."
fezy5kth1t,276,not sure i like the whole over motion blurr
8j1vc7g49w,277,gl with it and dont be worried it is still a great image its just imo unorigional never seen it in orange tho o
8j1vc7g49w,278,"loevly gorgeous ,petals are so smooth!"
3ksujh88ki,279,i like the show of motion and the sharpness of the falling pieces.
mm0z459lp1,280,"fine. although im sure you took this with a twosecond exposure, i see it more as a multipleexposure image."
mm0z459lp1,281,technically pretty well performed but visually im not sure. lacks more contrast in my opinion.
7fj4gpm1em,282,colors and light and motion makes this soo delicious to look at. smooth. .
7fj4gpm1em,283,well composed and super cool motion photograph. very nice!
9yczv94knh,284,this looks to me like a multiple exposure rather than a second exposure.
xauo7k0kxr,285,"bit grainy, but that could be a result of iso. like the choice of bw. works well with the roof"
5tzk62bnrk,286,nice shot.i would have liked it better without the electric pole. the color change is very nice.

gn4at4tmra,300,"nice leading lines. not as much color as many of your competition, but well done."
h2pujy0o66,301,ooh! little blurry not sharp enough but love it
h2pujy0o66,302,"i liek the pic, but it does lose a lot of detail in ir."
pumvlcg8wl,303,i really enjoy the creativity shown in these type of shots. you must have been counting carefully to get such an even exposure in all three positions.
pumvlcg8wl,304,nice idea. a strobe wouldve reduced the blur not that i own one! a .
bi61c50j55,305,i think woulda been much better without the blurry person? imho

gm3mb22smk,312,the only thing that even comes to mind is. that is a lot of blue. lol
3uxijbze9h,313,looks old fashion. probably the colors. like them and i like the life in the picture o
3uxijbze9h,314,adding sepia made this photo it could have been taken years ago. i like that there are no true modern day images
m0ewz6syqu,315,would have been a ten if the upper colum highlight hadnt been blown.

a629igjqd8,317,"that blue is intense, but cool."
8tsobiqkxx,318,"its this kind of detailed, thoughtful description that so helps those of us trying to figure out a how you did it and b how we can do it."
h66ob2ypfb,319,wow. like hour of exposure i guess.
2n2b1krb3x,320,i like the noise. conceptual. i respect.
nlhpqj38e3,321,wonderful smoothness and light.love the reflections and the seconds really made them special
nlhpqj38e3,322,"love the calm mood of this, probably because of the soft tints and how the reflections fades into blur."
nlhpqj38e3,323,nice pastel shades and silhouettes
nlhpqj38e3,324,"stunning, would love to know how you make these colors. the pinkwhiteblue o"
7kv78bsm0j,325,"im getting hardly nothing here, i think my monitor might be a tad off, but the photo is very, very dark and quite blurry."

8tle9qz506,332,stands out from all the others and has a certain mysterious quality to it.
8tle9qz506,333,nice effect with the light and shadows onthe boat.but the purple seems to detract from the effect.

695nefreoc,340,"this is very appealing, nice lines and the blue tone adds to it imo."
695nefreoc,341,perfect exposure aswell id say.
k3dlv3gxar,342,"great idea, but what would have made it stand out more was to see more definition in the hands. i would have kept still for about seconds then started typing.this way the photo would have shown the hands more and get the movement for the last seconds."
lnlo1o8rk3,343,"cool colors, but a little fuzzy for me"
1ja1pnjo0x,344,the stars of light make the picture work. good job.
uh40b931d1,345,nice idea some how it doesnt have the wow factor for me. maybe better light trails.
opr17x25nn,346,"nice color, sharpness, use of a leading line."
9hgm2yyxkk,347,this is just completely hypnotic.the color and light are just so supernatural.very nice.

9hgm2yyxkk,349,absolutely love the effects in this picture. great colors. very mistical o
wuea1bt8qw,350,i like it. very sharp. even the flare from the red lights works here.
pkctv70mpf,351,nice idea. hard to see the motion of hte hands.
fe9ubn7z5b,352,"need more pop, more colors, and more originality !"
e8h9u8qour,353,love the color in this image.makes quite a striking abstract.nicely seen.
slwcey1b4a,354,"nice capture of the stars, but i think the contrast and saturation could have been uped a bit. also there is some grain in the mountians."
slwcey1b4a,355,i love the cool blue and the stars are so clear. something ive always wanted to try. you have captured this nicely
slwcey1b4a,356,"third of this type i meet here, still nice. let me guess again on exposure time to minutes? look forward to exposure details."

uuzu9rs2jm,363,"sorry but way too dark for my taste, and yes, my screen is calibrated so if this is bright for you, you might want to check out your screen settings."
uuzu9rs2jm,364,"i understand this was taken by night, but the flowers seem a bit dark and flat."
dq19h5fcwr,365,wow to the colors in this photo. without them it would have not been nearly as interesting

5ychkxgq98,368,i love the little ballerinas in the front.interesting colors too. nice job.
kq2whihzv2,369,nice color blur from the lights good control not to over expose.
m1z9cjmg6a,370,"im torn between the color your toned versions, but regardless, they are both great images!"
m1z9cjmg6a,371,"beautiful. at first i was going to say it would probably be more beautiful in colors, but. i dont know. perhaps this is better. at least i love it o"
6q3n2qh5oh,372,now thats funny. and a little fuzzy p but still. funny
8bcx1oej36,373,"ah honk kong, its a great light show."

4p76dmf8w4,375,"wow, what a beautiful picture. love the stars and the coloring. nice reflections."
x80vbpvju3,376,the eeriness of the green lights lends a wonderful effect. great job!
gw6v5kqd34,377,slightly dark and blurred. almost looks like a sonogram photo
k7kv4atbc9,378,"the white light really overwhelms the picture. great idea, the light hurts some"
hnf9ivhyry,379,feel sorry for your model. nice cold but soft feeling
yrznnz0apq,380,blurry and too much contrast imo
katezyz8ya,381,pretty different levels of color here. nice comp.
itqki1xm0s,382,"cold and alone. poignant image. looks like it could stand a little more work postprocessing, to really give it some kick."
0o0c2ulg3n,383,"eh. its not busy enough for me. also, the colors could be tweaked just abit."
rfa6hbs0ee,384,"a little too much light , but the idea is great"
fhktuqbfxs,385,i like the browns and blacks.looks almost desaturated in the morning light. nice job.
fh20nkjz8d,386,"wow, i really like the subdued colors and the softness to this. beautiful image."
71wfwrxw0d,387,i like the dark mood that this pic present. granyness adds intrest
fwq4omfakw,388,a beautiful model. a clarity of texture in this photo allow for me to say that this is one of the best portraits i have seen in some time. exquisite.
rohhj6l9b5,389,"sure, weve seen this done before many, many times. but rarely with such crispness and detail. very nice work! ill enjoy reading the details to see how you pulled it off so well."
rohhj6l9b5,390,fantastic! amazing detail! and to think you were awake enough to get this at am! a !
rohhj6l9b5,391,"awesome! great detail, good contrast, very nice!"
x4jovllgbk,392,nice contrast of these colours against the blackness. nice balance of light to dark.
vhg64a1qw0,393,"the lights above doesnt say much to me. your lights above is not sharp enough, your lights above needs a lot of work"
p14yforpq5,394,very good use of light and your figure well done
g4pc1crv0c,395,"very nice, i really like the softness of the morning in this picture."
d122scjnuc,396,theres something about the color in this one. very nice!
lyx4kupx14,397,great find . great exposure . colours work and the light is great. .
lyx4kupx14,398,"the more i see this the more i like it. its odd that theres nothing quite black in the image, though. very good work."
lyx4kupx14,399,looks like an advert. nice light.
y0i3sg2rc8,400,nice idea but the blur is too much for my liking tough to recognise.
ncgb226pzb,401,"a bit over exposed, hence the really bright hotspots in the lights."
xt9tzx8ad5,402,this would have been a great pic if the light was out of the pic and diffused.
066eudjf5x,403,this is soo good. what colors such spontaneity. very real too.
066eudjf5x,404,omg this is soo sad. i love the desat. color appearance and noise here. it just works
066eudjf5x,405,"excellent image. if im correct though, i think theres too much ni on this one. actually, now that i look close, it could be oddly placed noise as well. either way, it still gets a ."
066eudjf5x,406,"the photographer. and i find more faithfulness in my photographers as pure observers. i think of tony rayjones, of kertesz, of marc riboud."
ndqpvr95yv,407,too much grain. because your image is not sharp enough
ndqpvr95yv,408,"this works very well for me. youre gonna get murdered on grain, but of courtse you knew that i like the offnote of the eerie, bluish cast in the bright areas."
ndqpvr95yv,409,a little too much grain in this. i would think a light on her huddling in the dark would work better but its just mho
ndqpvr95yv,410,pretty cool. i like the grain here and the whole treatment makes it look like one of those spooky effects in those tlc documentaries.
ndqpvr95yv,411,when i saw this as a thumbnail it looked wonderful. but now i think that the noise has been a bit overdone. still a great picture though.
ndqpvr95yv,412,"something disturbs me with this image, but it also seem to me soft in approach."
vidldsrpcl,413,"honestly, i like the idea more than i like this particular image. this one takes too much work to reconcile. i wasam taken by the colors, but not by the effort to tell what im looking at. this does have potential, its just not being realized here in this image."
phoo3pd6tw,414,hmm nice work on the photograph but theres something about it that. i think its going to make it loose points. i think its the filter you applied to it.
3qg45js1oh,415,great colors. very soft tones and edges.
t3xgadptmr,416,pity about the motion blur
swq8kdsyma,417,heh. i just took this exact picture the other evening. mine has all red lights though.

9eto99j0l0,422,hehe cant believe i happened to be the only one who nitpicked on the flash hue
jjemmjsax8,423,better them than me. i like the almost everything blurry look with a few exceptions. it correctly conveys the hazy feel about early morning.
jjemmjsax8,424,"awesome use of blur, it makes the photo much more interesting!"
blzz76mai6,425,well done sara this is quality
blzz76mai6,426,my pick for the blue. i like the way it looks like theyre looking at a friend passing by who just said hey!
p3ojtjm9j4,427,the processing of this just makes it seem loud. yikes. nice motion with the arms as well. i wish you some restful moments.
p3ojtjm9j4,428,that is excellent. i love the movement blur from the little flailing arms.
pdkucjwty4,429,pretty and colorful and yet downright creepy. wonderfully lit. great idea.
lx6x6qutgr,430,"a great portrait, i do not love very much these colors, but it is a matter of taste"
j4b8t88cte,431,and the colorful pixels arent doing much good.
at9yhibf6l,432,"cool tones, give the image a really sharp feel and makes the pink in the laces really pop"
at9yhibf6l,433,theres just something about those classic shoes! i like it.
wjk1xm6fbg,434,i love the subtlety of the light. this is a classic for me.

uqrbtv3euq,442,"fantastic, some sort of blurring or something going on?"
3r70ufejfr,443,your colors are very well done.excellent processing and production
cv56wrl3l1,444,awesome colors it really brings out the coldness of this picture. very industrial.
cyh16twhqt,445,this may have been exactly what i was going for. i love the warm dark tones from which the light seems to emanate.
taxnmur9g8,446,lovely colors and pp technique. the textures here are superb.
f5ft93o6g4,447,great application of hdr whether true or faux
0shvkxtadf,448,i wonder what this looks like in colour. the bw is mostly grey which diminishes its appeal.
y47b5xb5cg,449,"i just love this, the sharp texture combined with soft gradations in tone. beautiful."
91rc3wznhl,450,good pic.cute dog.i think it could use a little saturation

vicasg30xs,454,extreemly well done. i love infrared bw. nice job. and great meaning.
30jfykzosx,455,needs to be sharper and better facial color.
8btkuah2l2,456,"maybe a little toobrilliantly lighted.i think im expecting it to look dimmer and softer, as if from candles or lamplight. youd risk lose some detail, but might add to the mood."
2kupsbyqer,457,"greed, lies, corruption, megalomania, stealing, awful colour schemes, closed software. whos the bloke in the picture? its not gates or balmer."
2kupsbyqer,458,"i understand your motive here, but the image doesnt hold much artistic or quality value. setzler"

a8za91z5my,460,beautiful pic! wonderful contrast of dark and light. give you a .
b7tm7t6rsu,461,shadow intrusion at oclock.
b7tm7t6rsu,462,a little less light on the subjects might have resulted in some more color in this photo. you caught your shadow too!
b7tm7t6rsu,463,shadow in bottom kills it.
b7tm7t6rsu,464,your shadow in the pic is a definite downer.
nvrfbyclos,465,"hehe, i do this! nice use of black and white."
nvrfbyclos,466,"kewte idea like the choice of bw on this. not a hugely exciting image and the humour really only works once or twice, but great idea!"
nvrfbyclos,467,good idea and execution. i like it. bw was a good choice. wingy
buax5rzwhg,468,great shot.strong composition.love the light and shadows
buax5rzwhg,469,i do not like the purple color in this photo. i feel that a more natural color would have been more effective.

ncxljmrz3o,529,"first, i dont think there is such thing as an f.theres just fs.and second, i like how you are showing some racial thing of some sort, and third, i think the expressions they have could not have been any less fake. looks kinda grainy too. and, who would go around showing their grades like that?"
ncxljmrz3o,530,good idea ! it took me a little while im talking seconds not minutes to register the a and the f. had it been in bright red maybe .
4ahawswfjt,531,"good sharp, clear b w with decent suttleness."
4ahawswfjt,532,"nice photo.like the fact you made it bw, much stronger that way"
4ahawswfjt,533,"looks like shes actually seducing the photographer! hes into her, shes into the photgrapher, almost seems like some kind of lusty menage a trois going on here. i would have liked to have seen this in color."
2r4my2kdfv,534,"the blur is hard to overlook, but the balance and colors are good."
l50gq2mflo,535,i suppose technically i shouldnt feel like im leaning. i like the orange colors.
l50gq2mflo,536,"too orange, but the content is good. how did this one look in black and white?"
2a9aghyvsp,537,lovely macro . shows lotsa drinking nice clarity and colors photosbyayme

qyvjkfhl9o,542,lightingscene is a bit flat greyish
jk9irh85a5,543,one of the better lust imo. i like the mysterious feel to this i.e. shadows.
2m8y4bmxfz,544,that looks more like wrath. you have good detail in this. jube
bpvjyiju7t,545,very well thought out and good imagination. content did it more than quality of photograph

tcmsae078u,548,good. i like the whole. orange look. u did good . keep doing more pics like that. they cool
mke5wzemiw,549,"the contrast is pretty flat, it needs blacker blacks i think."
mke5wzemiw,550,"nice photo, but the colors of the planes should be brighter. the blue angels have some of the brightest planes around, but that isnt evident."
35vhraenjb,551,very pleasant green and brown composition.like the angles against the curves
35vhraenjb,552,"a little blurry, needs a autolevels in photoshop. i tried it and it did wonders."
bo3991bo9x,553,pure porno. ive suggested you be disqualified.
bo3991bo9x,554,"disturbing, i thought it was tied together as ropes, awesome photo maybe a duotone bw would be even more effective, but great photo nevertheless paganini"
av4fame9ok,555,"beautiful colors, beautiful shadows, compeling image"
gelzqcdkd2,556,"interesting wallet, but the light looks like it came from you."
vbehripb5o,557,i like this picture alot. he looks very happy and content. looks like he could use some dental work though! your picture is very sharp and balanced. nice job. lnede
2wifylzaof,558,photo would have impacted more if it were less noisy and colors less muted
2wifylzaof,559,its a little jpg damaged. but i think that actually worked toward the mood of the picture. it actually turned out great.
2wifylzaof,560,wow i love the graininess! it has a very journalistic effect here.
9nard0gyph,561,is the read tone intentional?
9nard0gyph,562,"not too keen on the colour cast, but this would look great in bwhigh contrast"
b0lecwuiv4,563,"blurry, not best use of topic."
ns3cxlrisq,564,very good job! this picture really captures pure rage at its best.
o6py2so5ns,565,slightly confusing light spoils this a little which is a shame as its got a good look about it.

kqwo0he3v6,567,"blurry, grainy, poor image quality."

hjl9ndelj3,573,"cool pic, the time exposure is awesome."
z3ttpugsus,574,nice textures this would work well for a print ad great contrast.
iyo45mttxg,575,detail a bit too blown out in a few areas. i think the grainyness works well. i had thought it was pride until i read the caption i think you were going for wrath?
bgqzcarzi0,576,nice idea but bad colors . maybe my monitor
sf8kvoubar,577,if only it was that easy! excellent light and idea.
zwdxh2exh5,578,nice play with colours. too bad it looks pixelated.
bhlmjvgyb1,579,"good light and imagery. this is a professional quality image, well done"
b2nxn8gz9h,580,"this is an incredibly pale picture, where it is hard to make out any details, and it seems a little grainy?"
txrxyn7rwb,581,"cakes could be a little sharper. great eyes,awesome"
zz5m777rco,582,its a little dark but adds a sinister touch.
e8atidbkwi,583,nicw ahot great pose could be tonally more neutral and less purple but better than average.

8oybn5oros,588,cute kids. image needs to be sharper. good effort.
st0mgpai3j,589,hmm. i see dirty dishes. anyone couldve done that. plus the quality is horrible.
st0mgpai3j,590,"i think its a good idea but its too dark in the front,"
jin92983fz,591,that is outstanding quality! great job!
4im6l7k8un,592,"nice use of light, nice job."
rfwfa8wuq6,593,i would have like the frames white line to be green instead

wsalwizquo,595,"very funny, i like your take on this. nicely composed, lovely detail and of course the vibrant colors are lovely."
43z5ood11b,596,"beautiful display great green colors excellent work, technically."
43z5ood11b,597,"great colour and contrast, nicely composed and with good capture of motion. well done."

1vhs5a7oqb,599,"great color. very topical, excellent as journo pic"
kdrone0xo8,600,"i absolutely love this, i agree the sunglasses look cheap, but im into lofi in certain photos so i kind of dig the noise, although i doubt it was on purpose."
40vugp9nwm,601,"im sure youve already been hammered on meetsdoesnt meet. i really like the black backgroundand the colors are great, particularly the yellow. it really almost glows!"

0i14t7h58r,603,nice photo! fit perfect in bw .
q5ii8o3nxs,604,"funny, but the conversion is a bit flat, imo."
q5ii8o3nxs,605,certainly looks greedy! nice contrast and tones.
vskad3uvsy,606,i really like the texture and sharpness here. it looks so real its unreal. nice job.
ccty7a13ak,607,seems too soft for the type of clock.but interesting all the same!

8hbs0qy6df,609,"amazing capture, excellent use of black and white."
8hbs0qy6df,610,"bit busy to figure out what happens here exactly, but this is a moody photo with a great exposure. its good in bw, but i am curious how it looked like in colours."
pilj6y0qsn,611,i suspect the use of neat image was slightly abused. otherwise a great idea.
pilj6y0qsn,612,"beautiful, a little grainy, but a great photo never the less"
az56ql3p96,613,this is a really beautiful find. ita bit blurry and overexposed. i still like it.
az56ql3p96,614,i like the fac htat the colros are brihgt. its like hope as a bright light ahead.
az56ql3p96,615,nice use of showing all it takes is a little.beautiful use of colors.
ck2fx69d2e,616,faith is a popular model. i love the use of the colour blue against the silhouettes.
yq40b43ekz,617,"lovely black and white photo of this children hopeful for something better, but at peace."
ktrbyrh4fd,618,"very moody photo, the dark tones are scary, but the light breaking out fills me with hope. if this was the purpose, its very well done."
uk7snqzmua,619,idea is very interesting but the shades of green are strange
flidjyqwqb,620,"interesting use of leading lines, wish the corss was a bit sharper, or even had more of a glowing effect to it."
cruwlmeibe,621,i really like the overoll bright appaerence of your pic.
63w817v9az,622,very nice but colours are too dull and the pic is too blurry.
v3uz57j9bi,623,dont know. like the idea but its much to toylike for me. a bit darker and mor mystery woulde have been nice

7p6j62awuy,626,"of course, its hard to light glasses too, so maybe thats the way it is."
7p6j62awuy,627,very sweet interpretation of justice and love the distortion caused by the glasses.
ikxxx72mlp,628,hmm.intersting. the white is a bit too bright for me.
gxpmiovyre,629,such a great classic early s bw study reflecting the work of the masters
een12kx6qf,630,"would have also been a great duotone. funky image, interesting technique."
een12kx6qf,631,overexposed on the whites and the colours are very strange. it must have been better with the original colours.
z62zlwiwan,632,"light in the darkness truly represents the feeling of hope. it would be even better if the rocks in the front would be darker, it would not then compete with the distant light pulling me."
g4wbavhoe9,633,brr! i shivered just looking at your photo. a brave model. i like the light and shadows though i do wish the shadows were a bit stronger darker.
fc78t6tx7q,634,i love the richness of the mohagany doors and the purity of the white habit. .
hbk252qd80,635,"perhaps wouldve tried increasing saturation as well, as the colours are a bit muted"
g16rmw2wvg,636,needs to be sharper. id like to see some details on the key.
a2t2aw7kdw,637,"too dark. i assume those are praying hands, but i cant tell. what is the squiggly line above the arms? nice idea, but it needs to be reworked."
a2t2aw7kdw,638,"woulde have liked a bit more light, i like dark pic but a just a bit more."
hm1jjcbao0,639,good example and a nice light effect.
n1okb0kp7h,640,excellent timing. good sharpness and colors. but not very sure of the association between mothers love and charity. i am not underrating this image because of my doubts.
ukwenlliki,641,color saturation and hue colors are natural and fit well with this image.
ww7p1guh24,642,good action capture  but to me picture appears to have a slight blue tint.
blfstpxub6,643,"color saturation and hue colors are reasonably accurate, even after some processing. nothing is over saturated."
ey9rfylibx,644,"no word of a lie, the first thing i thought when i saw that photo was great selective desat"
ey9rfylibx,645,really rich vibrancy in the purple.
61nm5vswh5,646,color saturation and hue colors are realistic and accurate.
8y9ktw9x1f,647,i love this photo! it definitely makes me want to know more of the story.the colors and patterns are striking as well
7mcm2wpre8,648,"i can see the white balance being off here. if i am correct and the lights are tungston, a tungston white balance preset would have saved this image from being so orangeish."
7mcm2wpre8,649,"not bad, the idea of the tarots is good. i dont like the color temperature here, it seems too much hot."
f96ixzuxtb,650,im diggin on the contrast.

xfhdk568kv,652,"very nice shadow work, powerful image."

urszm56f98,654,i love the blue and white vs the orangeyyellow glow. magnificent!
7qablffhk8,655,color saturation and hue colors are natural and within expected parameters for this type of image.

pqvho5z28i,657,"hahahahaha very nice, i love it! , would give but the bluish tinge kinda distracts me."
pqvho5z28i,658,"not quite sure how the batteries will be used, but i really like the details and color in the picture"
7b7aqyv8bx,659,the image is a bit dark and kind of mucky.
c0azrv5cex,660,"could be sharper, more focu on the duracell."
2xx2fsxczg,661,i like the colors. good motion capture.
936pqk0bz3,662,"this is perfect. idea, compoziton, quality!"
k7kc1nt32q,663,"i assume you tweaked the color on purpose, but it just appears to be a bad color image to me."
k7kc1nt32q,664,"the overexposure is unappealing, sorry."
jpmof3pwvz,665,ah its soo smooth. very nice.
bzg7zkkwjl,666,hope u give longer exposure . still good idea
ak2ug70u71,667,"good idea and execution, wish for more light, but i like it a lot."
c8e7265mak,668,i love the slight grain to this. it has that interesting grungy effect making even batteries look cool
yyo2dmzfu2,669,absolutely perfect without the shiny line at the bottom!
yyo2dmzfu2,670,"the yellow line distracts me, everything else is brilliant."
yyo2dmzfu2,671,"nice gradient, maybe it would be better without the bright line on the bottom. i like it nonetheless."
yyo2dmzfu2,672,"remains me ofthe twin towers, like the colors on it. great job"
yyo2dmzfu2,673,"i love this color scheme, and the photo is so smooth and clear nice work"
7iizmzlkun,674,pushing the rules to the edge. nice work!
7iizmzlkun,675,"as far as the photo goes, i think your light could have been more exciting, it is a little to straight on for my tastes. i like dramitic light!"
5ic19rhjwr,676,the pink colors and the exposure is a bit much.
v2azgb0s37,677,clever especially in the light of events with sadam hussein.well done.perhaps a little too much noise but thats minor
v2azgb0s37,678,dark humor in very well executed. great light. i like the duotone effect.
43u7zfuucg,679,"colorful and fun, the bubbles are great. very nice."
43u7zfuucg,680,wow! stunning colors and clarity and timing. .
w23rnsyeyy,681,"i got a chuckle out of this, and like the angles of hard light. i agree with"
w23rnsyeyy,682,"that the color temps too warm, though. would be interesting to see corrected, even as far as tungsten though that might be too cool."
4qswniod74,683,"wheres the aa? ahh, the one behind? so blur."
g4r0thppla,684,"great splash capture, but its way too underexposed."
takg4smr87,685,a real quick and easy white balance is as easy as
takg4smr87,686,guess the white balance needs to be changed.
takg4smr87,687,"the color is off on this a pinkish cast to all of it, even the duracell words. bad wb most likely"
vo9lwd4r0p,688,"nice idea, it made me laugh, but the actual picture is kinda odd. but nice try"
vo9lwd4r0p,689,weird idea. the white balance is off and there is a ton of noise.
42fzjijgop,690,"great idear annd well coposed, i love the colour too"
yagkyde8l6,691,ohmigawd! what a flat freakin howl!
n8nqzbfkfh,692,"imo it is too soft, some sharpening could help."
ftn1afhaa7,693,"i like the colour treatment here, nice work."
jvbzisww0y,694,"nicely done! great tone, great pov."
qrecvvxoyo,695,"almost looks too neat to be abandoned. i like the painterly editing, particularly what its done to the windows here. nice."
u7xzia7uad,696,"another masterful, luminous monotone from you, sir!"
6yhh0zvo8b,697,great find! looks totally abandoned. good choice on the bw conversion.
s49iig1k1m,698,conrats jeb on your red and a new pb.
s49iig1k1m,699,interesting colour to this. spooky. unreal.
5bbamqy6o4,700,nice idea. wish it were a little brighter to show the colors more. jmo.

2z6211x3kx,704,"very cool comp. and lines i am undecided about the color tones, though"

gizb5y19t3,708,magic light. excellent in all regards.

mt0wy89uxn,711,bleak gloomy. good find.
mt0wy89uxn,712,beautiful contrtast in the bw.
1p6ake8z0n,713,beautiful image! excellent find. id like to see a color outtake afterwards.
1irx4vp6sk,714,"i like this, is he a ghost? haunting, but not in a super creepy way."
1vqigmi7pe,715,interesting blocks of colour. leaving out the green has certainly made an impact here.
ss6230qqgb,716,"colors are a bit splashy, but i love the pov."
pgn6pzf17g,717,havent i seen this before? great idea anyway. not sure about the red highlights. i guess they kind of work.
20ac928e1u,718,"im not sure stranded and abandoned are synonymous. also, im not sure what the desat is doing for your image. maybe you wont see the humor in this, but im thinking the desat will make her pretty easy to find!"
19wgymr2pi,719,wow. great capture and absolutely lovely detail.
g1bp8swamm,720,a good attempt but it falls short on the quality of the image . sorry
te8fhc1so7,721,beautiful colors and processing here. doesnt look terribly abandoned though.
te8fhc1so7,722,very interesting light hue. very soft and warm. nicely done.

o3tendy6f7,725,wow.this is an unbelievably good offering. the dark and moody air works really well!
yr3knudqe5,726,awesome! the blues against the texture of the building is very nice
m0he49asec,727,all these ingredients in perfect balance
ik4l4luytz,728,"excellent use of light has made this a stand out image, just you hate the plaques they certainly mar the photos"
k9gyyfqqht,729,"great atmosphere, lovely contrast.subtle yet direct."
k9gyyfqqht,730,drama! pretty cool. like the red amid all the gray.
k9gyyfqqht,731,"wow this is really nice, love the way the building stands out. nice sel desat"
i4u7s1sh2n,732,good choice to use bw gives it a great feel. good job
i4u7s1sh2n,733,awesome bw here totally looks archaic v. nice
ylofzk0jvl,734,"this is a great buiding, but just a touch too much sharpening for my tastes."
s9bo3afo6j,735,"very nice job. nice colors. good lines. black there, whites need work. nice comp."
s9bo3afo6j,736,"oh wow! this is awesome! what a mood it conveys. abandoned and rundown, yet beautiful as well! excellent job!"

hpdtel96e9,738,"nice.i gave a little aaww when i noticed her. good saturation, not over done."
0h9uus7d9u,739,"this is so beautiful, ursula. the light is quite special."

0h9uus7d9u,741,beautiful setting and warm tones.
0h9uus7d9u,742,this one almost looks livable. i really like this picture. good colors and contrast. a winner.
0h9uus7d9u,743,i think youve got a winner here! this one really stands out among the pack! beautiful colors and clarity.
vlmgpw575j,744,"this could have used a little more light, seems everything is in the shadows so you dont get to see the colors or detail of the building."
9pm0gwpbxm,745,not too bad. the contrast is a little flat making it hard to distinguish much detail.
uqy6s6o9d0,746,"great job great find. could be just a tad sharper, but still a from me"
q27c5tzfrd,747,great study in textures and light.
5omfuxnto2,748,overprocessed. its lost a little of its clarity bc of the applied color. would have preferred to see this in bw or in its natural color.
5omfuxnto2,749,pinky color is kind of icky.barn is cool
v7zganwj3f,750,"this is a great building, however it is lost a little with the use of black and white."
v7zganwj3f,751,black and white is the only way to go with these old buildings. nice one!
mqsjn40d08,752,nice image. great colors. nice textures.
fwgkifm2vc,753,this is a nice image. i like the color of this image. i also like all the texture of the photograph. nice work.
5c0bd6osbb,754,soft and too dark of sepia tone to my taste
34iyjkc5fm,755,"nice dof.good, warm colors, too."
htma7qot64,756,i feel like the colors and the branches is just a little too much.my first reaction when i opened it was that i didnt know what i was lookinb at.
whza7yc8w1,757,not themeatic. nice texture. good color.
whza7yc8w1,758,great texture and striking color.
4vovwamk66,759,"i know this may seem to literal, but i would like this picture better if it was actually of a building. however, the photograph itself is of good quality."
aqoxt8u1cx,760,"the bw hurt this one. its way too dark. next time, if you want to go monochromatic, you dont have to use bw. i think a different hue would have allowed you to bring out more detail."
pp2jquckt8,761,looks like foundation issues. interesting color.
6rhhybixqh,762,bit darker to get extra mood in picture . ir
t7qdwa9sab,763,nicely done bw. the detail is amazing too. good job.
b932d1wdud,764,needs some straighting. could have used more light on the front of the building instead of having it all in shadow.
05raqq51pj,765,this is a nice image. i like the contrast seen in this image. i also like the texture that is seen throughout this photograph. nice work.
lvog11ofsw,766,a fine bw with a nice mood
zafs7vwgsv,767,this is a nice iamge. i like how this image was done in black and white. i also like how this image is dark. nice work.
7t3oinzsq1,768,nice pic! love the shadows and the light! looks nice in bw
i2ch15n35i,769,technically not a ten yet but the mood id def there
i2ch15n35i,770,nice to have the stairs make a leading line into the entrance. good seeing for that one.
n2p29mkjjt,771,why the black bands at thetop an bottom?
3khm7jxv72,772,"good, could be a bit darker, try diffuse glow and soft light some time"
gse8k37t1y,773,"i really liked the way you subdued the shadows in this one. monochromatic colors work well, but a splash of color would have added the interest to keep the viewer in the picture. still, a good one."
r5y63jdy7b,774,very interesting contrast of colors and texture.
uxw7huyvmn,775,excellent picture and light metering. very well achieved.
aqcrhpi69u,776,the sunlighting is so bright through the trees that we lose some of the features of this building.
aqcrhpi69u,777,"nice, gloomy and peaceful, to bad about this place being abandoned."
yxyvq22rcy,778,"nice setup, but it could use some sharpening. great effort."
9rsoeut16i,779,good sky.to far to see texture and color the buildings.
9rsoeut16i,780,"anyway, i feel this picture would have benefitted from some noise reduction and i find the red color of the houses to be bit too saturated for my taste. i think a bit of shadowhighlight might have benefitted the image."
p7supme7ft,781,great capture of an abandoned building. you did a good job with the contrast not over doing it. the mood is very effective. nice capture.
p7supme7ft,782,this is a nice image. i like the fact that the image was taken in black and white. i also like the fact that there is so much line throughout the image. nice work.
p7supme7ft,783,love the starkness of this one bw was perfect choice.
p7supme7ft,784,"always wondered where moonshine was made! bw was a good choice here. good lines, textures."

bzr2q00vp0,791,nice use of ps. nice lines. good color.
cxz2zsv1rs,792,like the tone of this photograph. makes the old building look even older.
4ye3melx6j,793,"they are old, but dont scream abandoned to me. good bw though"
rj8jslqzfr,794,there is a fine line between abandoned buildings and ruins. this photo looks to me more like ruins.
efmz258aa4,795,"i wish the colors were more saturated, im especially missing the deep browns and green that are often present in abandoned spaces as well as warm colors in general."
9h893nyawm,796,"still having a problem viewing this. my monitor? transmission upload issues? the twigs, branches seem pixelated, and the blues feel chalky. the trees arent popping maybe thats it."
9h893nyawm,797,this picture need color adjustment . ir
8d0g3khmo5,798,micknewton? lovely dramatic black and white. nice clear image.
47qd37h2wv,799,nice clarity. good choice for bw. would like to see this without the buckets.
7ng95c2099,800,so gloomy but a nice picture. makes me sad. mary
7ng95c2099,801,not quite sharp enough. good choice of buildings.
gje95833dk,802,"too bright. whites good, blacks barely there. nice comp."

itzb65cgnf,808,soft colors and peaceful. pleasant picture. mary
hyal1a62tx,809,"that being done, the postprocessing used here makes this look like a yer photograph. well seen !"
hyal1a62tx,810,this is a nice image. i like the fact that the building looks so old. i also like the fact that the image was taken in black and white. nice work.
749owz29hu,811,"video setting was at bit color, not bit."
tpbrhpuzzk,812,"as creepy as this is, i love it. the light is wonderful and illuminates the many colors so well. good job."
tpbrhpuzzk,813,"unless intended, i think the whitebalance could be a bit warmer. nice textures."
5wakpwribh,814,pleasant and soft. mary
brt16n5h9n,815,"great green and nice, sharp detail."
jt31l5ygvj,816,"very soft and pretty light, it makes something hard and crusty appear soft and forlorn.the flowers are nice too."
08qct20qyd,817,the cooler colors have an odd look to them.
ikbtg1v5f1,818,"dark, moody a good choice for bw conversion."
zsv9gjff49,819,"nice lines. whites need work. nice comp. nice texture. a bit soft, not bad."
6vx9wzsmsy,820,great colors and textures on this building. the power lines are a distraction though. good find
hq5tnzmi3f,821,"the colors on this make it really interesting. abandoned, yet somehow pretty too. good job."
hq5tnzmi3f,822,there is a fine line in my opinion between ruins and abandoned and this look more like ruins to me. excellent color and clarity.
lnpou2xf7o,823,love the contrast btw new and old good job!
wj8s9bq03n,824,colourful. pops. good stuff.
r17xbsd2if,825,something so charming and sad about the thoughts that this image invokes. the colors are well treated to enhance the age.
h75rxafpnw,826,great feeling of an old photo from the depression era. color great and soft appearance adds to old look. well done.
n6mzpwb7b4,827,"maybe check your colors. look like a lot of magenta red tint. of course if you did that for the affect, sorry."
3rxw4nz211,828,slight color adjustments in a software program or a slight adjustment on your exposure values would have improved this photo. very interesting building regardless.
clluj9t9f2,829,the grainy texture of the photo evokes the mood of its former use. good job.
clluj9t9f2,830,dont care for this yellow cast.but the grainy effect is nice

ounfuj20wt,832,nice tone to this photo. sharpness with softness.

l355os3v3h,838,this looks really neat with the darkness of the building and only the light from the windows peering thru. really good job!
jt797ig70e,839,a wee bit dark on my monitor.
jt797ig70e,840,"eerie. i love the dark, contrasty textures on the survaces"
oejo43mf38,841,"validated or not, the heavy violet tinge is disconcerting. time of day?"
oejo43mf38,842,"not especially fond of the color, but like the idea."
cmi20vnt7b,843,"good invocation of dreary, though a little more detail in the shadows would be better i think."
98lk79zxci,844,"i really like the color in this photograph, and how it composed. nothing that shows me it is an abandoned building, but ill take your word for it. well done!"
690mg454mf,845,good idea. i wish the picture had a little more contrast though. the shades of gray seem to blend together rather than standing out.
p0cxivc46u,846,the shadow in front detracts from the photo.
03tgvsmkop,847,i think this is where little red ridinghoods grandma lives
03tgvsmkop,848,beautiful photograph. you lost a little on the edges but otherwise really pretty. it looks great bw but i would like to see it in color too.
waq91sji4v,849,the color is way to harsh and removes details that are critical to the image
j1ljb2h20o,850,"i think the photo would be better if it were a bit sharper. and although the lighing works very well, there is nor much drama to the photo."
xdohecrnyp,851,"nicely done. you look like you did some dodging on the edges, but ill let someone else be the judge of that. this is a really good picture. its well composed and well balanced colorwise. this could be a winner."
i81i6a7alz,852,"oops, thats , guess youll just be getting a from me. i like everything in this, the lines, the starkness and colors, great job!"
i81i6a7alz,853,very cool. nicely balanced with both lines and colours. i love the different elements that popout. excellent.
na7s6nkt08,854,this is a nice image. i also like the fact that there is line all through the image. i also like the texture and darks and lighs seen throughout the image. nice work.
na7s6nkt08,855,this picture has such a lovely peaceful feeling.beautiful tones and light.
yfglqo3x2u,856,very charming and lovely bw. so sad.

unbd0n96mn,859,like the stark contrast although image seems nearly overly sharp just a smidgin too much.
unbd0n96mn,860,"wow, this has it all, a shady legacy, years of decrepantcy, i love the texture on the walls."
xpzv31nrrz,861,im not sure the sepia tone is helping this pic. i wonder how it would be in colour or black white?
xpzv31nrrz,862,the sepia tone doesnt work for me on this one. everythigs seems to blend together.
honcqkz66x,863,just a bit too dark. the detail of the vines are lost
lxspgi5eaa,864,love the color and crispness of this one.
xejd9eh4wn,865,this image has an interesting postprocessing artifact look which actaully adds to it and gives it a strange quality. is it due to excesive noise reduction?
xejd9eh4wn,866,i love the processing done here.a special filter?
ckcvfvi4wa,867,"woow awesome photo,i love the scary mood in it."
gf5epxvamu,868,nice use of bw and geat diagnonal presence!
gf5epxvamu,869,"this is a really cool picture in so many ways, like the light reflecting off the windows, the smoothness of everything, but im not convinced its abandoned."
avinxtc98q,870,nice color. i think a lot of the details would have been lost if youd chosen bw. good clarity.
100gz6lkmu,871,nice colors here. spooky place to be.
jf0k0durrd,872,i think this could have been better with less processing. at least on my monitor the colors dont look very real.
wh9d1iukca,873,nice detail and texture in this pic.
5qf0spsy9z,874,the soft light and luscious green really adds to this. an abadoned building thats pretty? youve accomplished it.
gtzzycfzax,875,lovely texture study! fine bw photo!
zcmuphbcbv,876,excellant color and exposure. your exposure settings bring out the detail very nicely and still allows to see into the upper rooms. i like this one.
ck35txqodr,877,i like how you printed this image although i think is a tiny bit dark. the distortion of the building works against the image. opinion
lumiw2yhz5,878,"c while i like it, the desaturation in your colors probably led to a bit of a disinterest as well."
hsx95ske74,879,id love to see this one in black and white. i love old buildings!
yrktq3hvmw,880,"nice idea, not crazy about the black and white, doesnt seem to be much contrast."
yrktq3hvmw,881,neat idea. great use of your debth of feild.
hwjok541zx,882,probably even the imperfectness wich emphazises this mood
vmltvvqfcs,883,this is a nice image. i like all of the line seen both throughout the building as well as in the trees. nice work.
kx3qv1ik3g,884,i liked this image a lot. the lively green makes a great contrast against the worn down building. good photo.
pzlxaghqel,885,"i would have liked it more if the color was a little more subtle, the colors are great colors that go together very will, just would look better muted some. i am very often guilty of oversaturating my colors. nice image and good capture of the light."
hdgezz0do9,886,"the color is good, and although the colors are bright, the building is still dark and dreary. its not a happy place at all."
hdgezz0do9,887,this is a nice image. i like the shadow seen in this image. i also like how old the building itself looks. nice work.
8u7tlw2iep,888,an excellent choice for bw conversion.
8u7tlw2iep,889,"coulda done without the run through, otherwise excellant bw."
8u7tlw2iep,890,"the contrast in this photo is gorgeous. however, i think that i would have like this better without the runners."
bjzv1qs85y,891,"as far as a photograph goes, i like the duotone feel to this like pure black and white with no grey. good job."
bjzv1qs85y,892,"very stark contrast i like the look personally, good photo."
bjzv1qs85y,893,this is a nice image. i like how much contrast is seen in this image. nice work.

ielkd6mglk,895,good image nice color to describe the mood of the image
3ec6h9bcvh,896,i love the soft greens in this one. great going.
3ec6h9bcvh,897,nice image and a different approuch to the topic. i like the tradional photographic quality that this photo has.
n3g60zelyv,898,"the picture has nice textures and colour, but needs a bit more of the overgrowth to give the feeling of being abandoned."
2q4kaj4faj,899,this image shines on with so much quiet majesty. bumping from to on great image quality.
pop3s8gxc0,900,"i love the tones, surreal like, missing a little sharpness for taste though"
glsftlm4v4,901,lovely. id like it a little bit more saturated.
5eu7veeq6c,902,not sure if bw was the best way to go for this one.
6gcnytgqp9,903,"over sharpening, but nice picture . ir"
7ddig2towu,904,a fine set of elements and delicate tone
7ddig2towu,905,"lovely tonality, very soft and subtle."
1s2ku9yjit,906,too squared to feel interesting. the pinkish purpletoned overcast is strange.
lgzfphhg6z,907,"cute. one announcement just wasnt enough. the image seems a little blurry, though."
rfqsp133ls,908,"seems to be too bright, nice comp tho"
oihfvh1215,909,nice pic.but should of shown texture of the mil here.
n8nvj0fnma,910,"not too much contrast here, maybe its me not liking industrial type buildings?"

05kwsxu3xo,912,great use of color. greens are beautiful.
05kwsxu3xo,913,"looks like this was quite a treasure at one time. now your image is a treasure. i love the textures, and colors. nicely done."
05kwsxu3xo,914,beautiful! the blend of colours is great.
lmhd9dmjgf,915,love the colors. too bad the bushes are there. i think. cant decide if i like ite better with or without.
lmhd9dmjgf,916,"i would love to know how you achieved this look in basic editing! it was exactly what i was going for, but was unable to achieve it without applying layers in modes other than normal. really nice photo! good colors and clarity."
lmhd9dmjgf,917,the dark cloud really adds to the atmosphere. i think a little bit of straightening would have helped though. altogether an attentiongrabber. well done.
6ysseim4hs,918,"very good photo, good contarst between light and shadows. well framed."
6ysseim4hs,919,good color choice. sepia would have also been nice. well done
6ysseim4hs,920,"those shadows are neat, it really gives the pic a certain mood."
06an3g91w7,921,this creates quite a mood. excellent use of contrast and coloration.
06an3g91w7,922,this is a nice iamge. i like the dark and light coloring seen throughtout the image and i also liek the texture and overgrowth on the building nice work.
06an3g91w7,923,straight on works well in this one. wonderful tones of sepia and white. gives this a moody feeling.
06an3g91w7,924,"very well seen and great tone selected! dark, uninviting and for sure, abandoned."
06an3g91w7,925,i love the mood of this picture. very dark and forlorn.
1ufjpmn6od,926,the colors and placement work well together.
e39aodrumi,927,i love this one. churches just strike a sentimental chord in my heart. the black and white works perfectly with this picture! good job.

9395n6m1fq,929,i really love the grasses in front of the building and the color contrasts. this is a really nice abandoned building picture!
27927qen1f,930,"interesting color adjustments, but the sharpening is overdone to my taste and degradates the image to where it becomes difficult and confused."
r43axqshbf,931,"little too highkey seems like it needs more contrast, not a bad photo, just not a wow"
r43axqshbf,932,black and white? i thought nthe rules said color and texture.
r43axqshbf,933,"has too much of a painterly feel to the image normally, not a problem. it all looks too gray and not sharp to me."
00i4w70pks,934,"nice choice for bw, though could have benefitted from being a little sharper."
gmlpo9jjee,935,nicely composed image and color levels without oversaturating the reds.
raeh1lvokc,936,"this image just needs some punch, lighterhighlights would add to the detail and give it some snap."
vv4ehrz2bb,937,"really like the colors, add a lot of mood to the photo"
vv4ehrz2bb,938,i have no idea how you achieved this hdr effect with only image. beautiful. .
8mtyfd4ios,939,"this may have been your intention, but a lot of the detail looks blown out to me which, depending on your taste, may or may not add to the photo."
2h5xevowry,940,"nice finish,very good photo and i can understand it loosing detail comming out to ? , i am in yellow getting closer."
o5wy22jjyo,941,very cool!i really liek the bricks in the doorway!well done on the bw.

tzvr08ssa6,943,love the colour in this image though and the textures are fab. good effort!
6bitupbjb1,944,i love this one just wish the colors were a little deeper.
vgylbj7u49,945,"well donecongratulations on the blue, where was this taken?"
neecnob0dt,946,more building less mr. pink
bxhgywebib,947,i like the intimate detail which shows the result of being abandoned and then you have the hint of the larger picture behind. .
zqosppsy53,948,nice image but looks a bit muted. possibly needs a bit more contrast to make it pop a bit more?
sed3sqvotz,949,bad coloring in this pic
dhtzigy1is,950,"i like the pov, but the colors are a bit oversaturated."
2y9rg9jzaq,951,this photo feels as if it black and white but has a ton of color at the same time. amazing job.
2y9rg9jzaq,952,"thought this might actually blue, but well done on the red special k enzo"
2y9rg9jzaq,953,gratz on second place. very well executed in colors
3myya8uy9r,954,the colors are phenomenal and the contrast is amazing.
kh4glliwjp,955,cool use of the flash on this one. the harsh light works great here.

rkd2ibrowz,958,nice comp and detail showing.

9mpjgoay0s,961,i like your silvery tones. nice.
ixyg1faeyk,962,i really like the contrast in this photo. i would have named it ugly beauty.
i72k5cx6ak,963,it has nice old west feel to it i would like to see in sepia.
6jrlh259kk,964,very nice pic. only the powerful green of the leaves in front distracts to me
6jrlh259kk,965,creepy and fitting did you try a bw version to bring out the tones?
kl9vr2oxqj,966,most impressive in its demise eh? this must have been an amazing place in its day
hkfhdrzi04,967,"totally agree jaime.an a pb as well.next red, then a blue.all the best. beautiful work"
tx13o2luz5,968,awesome. well done. id like to see a bw version of this one. hope it does well.
0cm52phrqr,969,i love the contrast here you can almost feel the different textures on the building. i hope they dont knock this one down on you. i look forward to seeing more of this building from you.
wrn02nzcbv,970,you would have gotten more from me if you had shown me just a tad deeper colors.
k8g1on8htw,971,i wish that traffic light wasnt there. it bugs me.
7hl43if7no,972,"i love this building it has a lot of character and the colors are neat. i think this image is a tad flat, i would try to increase contrast and play with the levels my opinion!"
eduo1yikpc,973,"beautiful picture, but i dont see a clear picture of what building is abandoned. they all blend, not one stands out being abandoned. not sure if any are."
4vukxhvl9m,974,a bit dark. it would neat in hdr but its a shame we are doing basic editing
qgqkz667u3,975,"a little dark for my liking, but a good effort."
sn5gdu3ikz,976,"wow, this looks neat. but the glasses look brand new and it destroys the old look.nice work though. i like the contrast."
9n1gikb8gm,977,handymans nightmare! great in sepia tones.
ah7mldw9wy,978,"what is the toxic green leaking down from above? i sure hope its just a misstep with your levels, because otherwise the hudson must be getting dirtier than even when i lived there!"
s07fa3qzbl,979,"i love this one! beautiful, soft and dreamy.shows what motherhood should be in an ideal world."
ipw7d76ggf,980,not quite getting the hustle and bustle of rush hour feel from this. maybe if the commuters had movement blur it might work better for me.
f1o9t7ylv5,981,odd! this is the third accordion ive seen in less than a week. not the most common instrument around. fantastic detail and tones! i kinda want to see more of the accordion though. like i havent seen enough in a week!
v2hngod2zx,982,"wow, very pretty design and colors!"
hxs8ruz8b4,983,love the colours. a bit overexposed. would have expected more detail in the petals.
s3ji6qcsdv,984,a beautiful image! some extra sharpness would make this perfect.
cr75m6bjgk,985,pure joy! the selective desaturation works beautifully here. perfect! love it!
cr75m6bjgk,986,"tremendous photo a little too cntral perhaps, but great capture and use of desat."
cr75m6bjgk,987,"the desaturation kind of makes him look demonic, which is not the effect i assume you were going for."
4qgw4g0m9m,988,"technical i dont know how the technicals could be better, but they probably could. maybe its a little too sharp if anything."
9oaklbftrb,989,the postprocessing and choice of colour really make this work.
wgvnzgp9vt,990,"nice image, like the shadows and rich colors being advanced editing, cloning out the powertelephone line would have made this better, in my opinion."
h6g0o6r4wy,991,gosh! excellent image jimmy! good for you on the blue! very well done
tfg67mipx3,992,"butterflies copulating desire l well from a scientific standpoint its a great image, from a photographic standpoint its full of texture, shapes and colors! nicely done!"

1kefx622pw,995,"a bit dark, but i give you credit for originality!"
5vya0grvsr,996,"for me, the flash seems a little harsh and the obrder is okay but it seems to be crowding the quacker. i do like the vibrant orange legs and detail on the feathers."
cfq5gdy072,997,wonderful sentiments here i think the image suffers a bit from being a little flat increasing the contrast even a bit and adjusting the levels could greatly improve the impact of this image
zg381eouca,998,great capture! needs to be a bit sharper though. theres not a lot of detail to it.
s3gi8cglpd,999,kermit has green wheels. thats a lot of bright green!
d3ahpd1no7,1000,"enzo, this is beautiful and moody. i also really like the second outtake with the light rays. nicely done!"

i3zm9u958j,1004,technical a bit soft or something
33i5zg9mkz,1005,"aww, arent they sweet. the color seems maybe a little flat to me though. i wish it had more saturation or turned into a full sepia or bw image."
33i5zg9mkz,1006,"they are blissful, and fat. the desaturation wasnt needed."
wyh6wysl1n,1007,i am not sure that rotating it makes for a better presentation. nice clean bright colours.
bxew51kcq2,1008,"for me, i think rotating your image a degree or two counterclockwise would help and perhaps removing some of the yellow cast or maybe changing this to a black white photo."
qzt7ob8r4y,1009,"eww hehe jk. very sharp image, really nice effect with the shapesfingers and colors"
sl0ij8th4t,1010,"i can see the beautiful and confident. but the deadly? like the pose. would like to see a little more detail in the dark areas, especially her clothes."

q4tb9wtxw2,1023,great candid portrait with good details and backlighting.
0n8ifm77lm,1024,"i bit blurry, but the message is clear!"

10u6i6yxjk,1045,it is a little soft and some of the bugs are a little lost. nice idea though.
hpd7ods7l4,1046,nice detail. but it doesnt pop or soothe. a bit of an inbetween image.

m7pwnul5qx,1151,beautiful colors and capture. you did a great job avoiding unwanted reflections.
okba9wdh8q,1152,the very severe black and white here is extremely cold to me in a way that contradicts the intended message.
8l8dgnarr4,1153,this is beautiful. the colors and sharpness are wonderful! so clear.
8l8dgnarr4,1154,i love the color contrast and the fact that its assymetrical makes this image more stanning. i love the details of the drops. they truly look like jewels. the different sizes of the drops are captivating. love.love this image.
wl1156g9oa,1155,"i really love this the grain and the way its outoffocus add to it a lot for me, but at the same time its also just a little bit too outoffocus"

9quy2b96by,1164,lovely. dark and brooding
44xi9tdgb2,1165,not sure i like the blurry sort of quality here
j6hic5sqw9,1166,very interesting. i think the color choice and intimacy works well. i hope this does well.
7gqxpxpntm,1167,"the tones, texture, luminance are just stunningexceptionally well done"
ghphujh1ik,1168,smokin hot! excellent and a all the way.
0dsuxxzpju,1169,"been there, tried that. and got the same blur result, heh"
0dsuxxzpju,1170,i believe i applied a light dose of lucis and some burning and noise reduction.
rc86pqzhxw,1171,you should have had a shadow of somebody falling down the stairs. then you could have called it pain. it seems a bit somber to me.
d6991bi83v,1172,seems that there is a little problem with the white balance
d0tu56gc6d,1173,i feel a happy confusion from this image. it is very psychedelic. nice colors.
ns5vvyr7vo,1174,"it conveys more of a delightful feeling to me than panic, sorry. the image itself is nice. i like the red shades. and the artistic presentation!"
ydwt8t7jd9,1175,seems to restful for melancholy. but it is a beautiful image. i love the color and design. i feel uplifted and calmed by this.

oyuw01ayvq,1177,this picture is unique and funky but would be a lot better if it were clearer. the light spots seem somewhat harsh.
oyuw01ayvq,1178,"technicals? colors are interesting, but the bright white parts detract for me. i think, for me anyway, it might have worked better with less of the blown white blobs and more of the color sections."

l8q9wrb1oa,1215,yeah.cause its orange.
wjufqwn8sz,1216,love the postprocessing. its a little dark but works well with this image.
pg22ss96vl,1217,the color seems pretty flat here maybe a boost in contrast or saturations would help give it more pop

hkl949159g,1261,"the colors dont seem like the pop as much as i would like them to. the red is nice and vibrant, but the yellow is just kind of dull. i think that if the yellows stood out more against the red, that it would help to add some visual appeal."
97nc3na9jc,1262,the white appeared blown. some colour could have complemented the green and made the image more interesting.
erw2mqob0m,1263,"for something soo rusty i kind of would like to see more details, that rust must have been glaking ir had deep cracks and chips, would have liked to be able to see those clearly, the rust here looks too smooth just has colored blotches"

8jkgnxdt9r,1542,"great job showing motion, the primary colours are really nice."

t4p2ylz9j4,1544,good motion capture. love the effect on the front paws.
xjsw08m7nj,1545,"its intriguing, but the blurriness throws me off a little. id like to see what it looks like a bit sharper."
ecpi68c37b,1546,whats the opposite of centrifugal motion? nice idea carried out very well!
o56z22dq3r,1547,you definitely did a good job with the motion blur.
ituud3t12z,1548,good job with the motion blur.
ituud3t12z,1549,"i like the red and the green quite a bit, but im afraid that the legs really dont add much in my mind. sorry!"
ituud3t12z,1550,maybe just a tidge less motion would be more impacting
tq5wynvgbb,1551,wonderfully composed curves with a definite feel of motion. nice one.
tq5wynvgbb,1552,i like this translucent color and curves in the highlights
yn2ejthn4i,1553,i like the parallelline of color yet it seems to have spinings motion

nbvhvy5c8h,1560,are we dead yet? nice motion effect

h1lkdy3i5p,1568,reminds me of soundwaves. i like the bright vibrant red!
1h5yma2654,1569,"i like the lines very much, but even though i dont believe that all abstracts need to be bright, loud colors, i think it would be more interesting imo with more vibrant colors. i just looks kind of muddy."
m17xnd9p0x,1570,i like tones and motion in this capture
nx6tet2chf,1571,nice light but not much motion?
me5vhg65ul,1572,"nice job on the motion, this is very intriguing!"
oy84iy1nwh,1573,i like itits very interesting. i think the wonderful orangey browns and greens could be brought out even more. neat picture.

fs0zsca6ec,1577,beautiful picture! flowing and mysterious. great contrast
665rlsaidg,1578,"technically, it is very well done. a lot of times this technique is better described as blurry mess rather than implying motion."
665rlsaidg,1579,another example of your impressive ingenuity. well done.
gvine8plff,1580,good capture and use of light.
81qj2en92j,1581,great job showing motion and nice use of complimentary colours!

w67if35nq0,1583,definitely a good feeling of motion here!
sjfvsy4042,1584,love the strands of light and motion
sjfvsy4042,1585,this would have rated a ten if there was less of a jumble of color and movement. this is one image that would benefit from less color and motion than more.
ioq14e0mew,1586,"love the blue, and the soothing shapes"
l4ffpyu4qw,1587,"a little to much blur for me, but the color is awesome."

5r74elu6fl,1596,"colors jump out at you. well framed, but for the life of me i cant guess what it is!"
z8hwax5x2e,1597,i like the feel and the abstractness of the slinky. nice tone of the capture very nice

cc8zrbu1k2,1606,your colors are really good and strong.would like to see a super sharp image all the fine little details
ex0un8w7kx,1607,been experimenting with a stronger ir filter also which showed that effect
kxpe01wbut,1608,that is the prettiest x weve had for sure beautiful contrast.
d32raad0fq,1609,a little less contrast and this picture would be much nicer.
eesk436d1u,1610,this photo is not an accidental letter but it does have good detail and color
pm6q3sjdq7,1611,the h is a great find but the photo fails to hold my interest. maybe color would have been better.
ru9ggm8mfm,1612,"nice sharp picture and fun ws, but its a little plain."
ru9ggm8mfm,1613,i think this would look better in bw with some contrast adjustment to bring out the w
x1rz5ggyqh,1614,"wow, this is a great bw. good job!"
x1rz5ggyqh,1615,like the textuer here. bw is good. am curious to see it in color.
x1rz5ggyqh,1616,its odd but on my screen seems to be blurry in some places and over sharp in others. id that a shore line? parhaps i would have liked it more in color.
icyfk1kkrr,1617,this is an appealing image. i think the letter l is a bit obscure but i still like it very much.
3i0rbht9lo,1618,its a pity the quality of the image is so poor! nice idea not so well executed. a
2g5xw0fj17,1619,great contrast between the black and white elements.

475vi10a6y,1623,neat blurry effect but maybe a bit too much. but i still like it!
18wy1pgtgm,1624,too much to look at in an otherwise quality pic
j7bxi6hp2s,1625,beautiful idea. i love how the colors are meant for each other. i would have done a tad with the saturation but thats just a matter of taste.
2tbz6rlp7d,1626,beautiful image. bw being my love.

30mp5cl1cu,1630,"just a magical blend of color, with sharp detail. really appeals to me. !"
f07tlbv9v2,1631,this would have been more interesting if rotated degrees. good use of color.
ywxmpgkw85,1632,nice job. almost looks photshopesq. need more hints of white to balance the black.
n9o4ehk8l3,1633,"good idea, but a bit underexposed. it has a lot of shadow over it."
15hwur636c,1634,"wow what a perfect accidental z wish it could have been a tad sharper, but its outstanding."
mrxl24c350,1635,"l and v look artificial, nice idea though ."
w6whe6v5gx,1636,i also see a prominently.the colors are lovely.love those palo verdes.right?
ipeurozj88,1637,"surely i can not capture that. still, very boring pic, you could use colored waterlights to enhance this type of capture."
osmk6n3aup,1638,"excellent! nice dramatic light, too."
z1ywxx7two,1639,"awesome ! what an idea you had here ! its an excellent picture,the use of black and white works well."
z1ywxx7two,1640,this is the first one i have seen tonight and its great. not only that its a word but that its a good image too. nice balance of bw
ixcmpqjvt0,1641,"good visible z, a tad oversaturated for me, not sharp enough imho."

602pwv1btc,1643,this is a nice image. i like how you have a lot of texture that can be seen throughout this image. nice work.
gd1macc51y,1644,this is a neat image. i like how you were able to find so many different letters throughout this image. nice work.
hfspw8asoh,1645,i can see the e but it took a little imagination. nice contrast.
zzxd7c0xnd,1646,this is a pretty good picture. if it were possibly a little closer or a little sharper i would have liked it even more.
zzxd7c0xnd,1647,"this is neat.i like the way you captured the image. this was a very creatice idea, and i like the way that you can see every bit of texture int he bricks. awesome hsot."
qpa1rem3bm,1648,i did really like the colour contrast and the sharpness of the photo.
qpa1rem3bm,1649,k v r d? i dont see it. sorry. nice sharp pic though
vraswc56nl,1650,the light is dull and you can see a little noise if you look closely. i think its a good idea though.
vraswc56nl,1651,wonderful image with lovely soft touch. well done!
a9mfaggsuj,1652,this is a nice image. i love the way the building looks. i also love how textured your image is. nice work.

t8nzcgo6jn,1655,"nice colour contrasts, especially amongst the pebbles. very real stones."
usyzhkbvk6,1656,"the dominos were manmade and setup, but the h is an accidental occurance. i really like the textures and colors."
d7lmc4r21e,1657,"i am not sure what you mean, i did not turn anything cyan, and no dodging did occur. maybe your monitor is playing tricks?"
d7lmc4r21e,1658,"if the image was sharper, and cropedthis would be a little tighter, this would be a ."
ibt9jd2v3s,1659,this picture looks pretty grainy and blurry.

8wtamxnv0p,1661,"wonderful find, color! good job. winner."
8wtamxnv0p,1662,"the colors and image of e are good.i like it, its interesting and starkly effective."
8wtamxnv0p,1663,this is a nice iamge. i like how you were able to capture the e in this image. i also like the bright bold colors. nice work.
ws3fgxknjf,1664,what a cute idea its so colorful the only thing i would do diffrently is have all the marker tips facing the same way
tdov51ksa7,1665,"great photo also, its cool that its v for veteran. nice color."
mdpo2oialq,1666,this is a nice iamge. i like how you were able to capture this image. i also like how unique this image is. nice work.
ym2xw7hkse,1667,the light seems a little harsh in this picture. maybe it should have been taken at a different time of day or decressed the exposure?
iblomwdtvk,1668,very nice. good color and the rocks add texture.
j5ig9gqibd,1669,plenty of beautiful vs and one huge g for green with envy! what a beautiful place!
j5ig9gqibd,1670,"i can found one, big clear and sharp. more es, one z, an i, api symbol and one m."
an29j3014i,1671,this is an impressive b. bravo!
02z6u4hfjp,1672,i hope those arent lifesavers! oh frootloops! pretty cool but color seems off. it doesnt pop.
2aj2ovhcvo,1673,good choice for black and white. dont care for the shadow on the bottom of the g.
2aj2ovhcvo,1674,nice shot.love the bw.the shadows and light.
5wiycd0uvn,1675,this is a nice image. i like the textures that are able to be seen in this image. i also like how there is pretty much no color bu there are little bits ofgreen in the image here and there. nice work.
glme1agi83,1676,looks real soft on my monitor
d23yqnkaal,1677,this is a beautiful picture! the only problem is im having a problem finding the accidental letter. im torn between an a and a w. i do really like the sentiment of the picture though.
9g2wkqduz9,1678,the weird white glow around everything makes this look overprocessed.
foy3irs7qx,1679,"beautiful picture, amazing color. not much of a letter though."
0a5panhku8,1680,"i like this, dont know why but i think it has something. bold lines bold contrast, i find it interesting. very well done."
yl6zcg0eh3,1681,"very interesting and original image, with amazing detail and a beautiful saturated green. one of my favourites."
t5mlamslo7,1682,splendid view.maybe the colours a tad weak
kqtawz8a51,1683,what is that red distraction below? strange and good find but not interesting pic at all.
jp9icfvnh2,1684,"love the selective desaturation here. it really adds to the photo, and emphasizes your letter. great job!"
xkusqnhipc,1685,the photo feels a little dark in some areas and a little over exposed in other. nice capture though.
7sl9ueq2ay,1686,a great sentiment and some great shapes
66gxmmyx9h,1687,"i learnt a new word today. i am seeing the letter e. but i find it a bit hazy, even for clouds."
pqdiqyj0mh,1688,i always find it interesting how plants can grow in such apparently random ways to make such cool shapes a good find for the letters i just am not convinced that color is the best choice for the image the colors almost seem to get in the way of seeing it
ckk35q6uh6,1689,"nicely done peter, i really like the texture and contrast."
a4jnw4hl4l,1690,im distracted by the strange wrinkles in the image it appears as if this is a photo of a photo.
xcp9guftyl,1691,this is stunning. lovely colours and is sharp. good work
lrgi8c70gm,1692,really nice macro choice for letters the shadow is really good and spooky
b02rv1btji,1693,i really cant see the letter in this one. i also feel that clouds are a bit too dark and the psing wasnt done evenly over the whole photo.
hxpy662szu,1694,"if the contrast would be a littlebit more, i would have given this one . great picture."
w4fr9r7bxu,1695,cool coloration. it kind of reminds me of the beginning of the wizard of oz.
4avnxohnc1,1696,"really hot, very hotnspicy"
4avnxohnc1,1697,"i love this, making the jalapeno look hot is both funny and really effective."
7f93wtenwg,1698,"love this image, nice creativity. beautiful colors. should have ribboned!"
1m066dtgw8,1699,initials used instead of acronym. a little blurry.
qkuy9pqkyq,1700,i love this one! the color and contrast is beautiful.
lih64hxzsm,1701,looks fun! black and white works here!
6759ardkg5,1702,"ok, i just calibrated my monitor yesterday and i cant see hardly anything here.im staring still cant see it. boo.it seems interesting, but i wish it was just a little less dark."
tu6guj6w05,1703,nice clarityfocus! good color.
0pp5t4jc7q,1704,"depicts your acronym quite nicely! i like the fuzzy stuff adds even more credence to the acronym, since it kinda represents the paths data takes."
idui8ppi2e,1705,excellent image with a lovely soft touch. nicely done!
idui8ppi2e,1706,a true acronym! refreshing! very clear photofocus wnice soft tone!
3bmrgi8i0r,1707,academy of motion pictures arts and sciences.
opvnsfkjyu,1708,very pretty photo! gorgeous color. even if bsa isnt pronounced as a word
vh6ju23dge,1709,"a bit red on the slabs, but nice anyway"
vh6ju23dge,1710,"is fm an acronym? the color in the sidewalkdriveway is impressive, along with the design of the bricks!"
ssaajfhdsx,1711,"what a great example of taking the ordinary and making it something special. the light sparkles, and those pretty blue lights make it look so ethereal and pretty! i really like this!"
lscixloqnn,1712,"great job, very nice, maybe a little too smooth, but nonetheless great image."
lscixloqnn,1713,i likent the flou effects for mascouline portraits and the pink tone is terrible.
zfkylpezc9,1714,"nice image, shadows are a little uneven on the peas"
x6o0ndlwyh,1715,good idea! good sharp colors!
x6o0ndlwyh,1716,"thats how i learned my colors, alright. nice arrangement."
x6o0ndlwyh,1717,red orange yellow green blue indigo violet
2x1u4yvicw,1718,hahaha! hilarious. a little hard to look at since it is so unsharp but it sure made me laugh!
8z5d3bkiju,1719,"good bw, and an easy acronysm."
3i0d4lhsbi,1720,this is a great capture! you can feel his joy. the bw is a nice touch.
2f6d98odbv,1721,wonderful photo. well presented and great bw conversion.
bdb5nb2ito,1722,"wow, the colors and refections are wonderful!"
bdb5nb2ito,1723,"great color, nice reflections captured here, but where is the acronym?"
sh7et3qw52,1724,"i love orangutans, i would have liked to see you take advantage of there wonderful colour, but still very efective"
oqldzbsnpu,1725,rofl no kidding. one step and ooh noo! nice comp and colors.
jcjkl5r15d,1726,"you captured the acronym well, technically looks soft and has a pink color cast on my monitor."
0vsk228vm3,1727,timeless and beautifulk great soft feeling and bold comp.
8fiqnij5hb,1728,love it! the colors look over saturated and its awesome except on the lips its weird imo.
6ab2mjxsw4,1729,"coulnt figure out what bugs stand for. bugs is sure a word, but not an acronym ? love the colors!"
axropzvsvl,1730,"i dont think this is too dark at all. the darkness of it suits the image real well, it looks like theyre talking about something secret, or real important"
axropzvsvl,1731,a little dark and a bit blurry
2sm0wtfkhb,1732,"dots per inch, in red green and blue. very nice"
5b3tfg4jyd,1733,incredible image. i hate the fact that you got those ones. if my calculations are correct had those s been s the minimum this should have gotten you get the blue.
5b3tfg4jyd,1734,well your shadow is wacky yet good
9vkpbvh3de,1735,"not quite sure how the photo illustrates the acronym, but the colors and tones are lovely."
835ifcxwhe,1736,i like the desat but the image needs a little roatate
xddd4f29bb,1737,light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation
27j9n97psj,1738,maybe a little overexposed. not sure if you could do something to add more contrast.
1aoecsu8kn,1739,"this is neat, ive tried this before, its fun, good job!"
1aoecsu8kn,1740,i like the way the light on the balls tracks the path of each of the balls.
51q29b86t8,1741,"to be honest, i do not like hunting, especially on birds, but thats my personal taste. the image is somewhat nervous and grainy and dark."
f10t2oq0yo,1742,"lovely mallards! id take the saturation down just a smidgeon, but the subjects are nice and sharp."
f10t2oq0yo,1743,"nice, but the colour is unnaturaly intense. maybe its my monitor."
k1bgcdvqpm,1744,"with enough legs, you can swim many strokes at once. beautiful capture, nice coloors, sharp photo."
7ik6o2itys,1745,one of my faves. i love the blurry joy!
0svi9kr1ni,1746,a tripod and shorter exposure maybe would have helped.
nisl41t9mu,1747,such a rel shame this isnt sharp as it has everything else.
pqna9zz821,1748,great capture of a frozen movement. the detail is amazing in this photo. just love it.
dvtzbpxope,1749,"very good. angles seem off, but great idea and good exposure."
dvtzbpxope,1750,the austerity of the building contrasts nicely with the blur of the fair.
45j1etnirs,1751,"you have frozen the action well, but it is a shame the quality is poor and looks massively sharpened to compensate."
45j1etnirs,1752,"nice timing, but very poor quality picture."
45j1etnirs,1753,great action to capture but its just too blurry and too oversharpened. nice try though.
45j1etnirs,1754,"maybe a little overprocessed. i tried getting a capture like this, but your timing is better than mine."
k07ed719fn,1755,interesting idea. i love the colour of your pictures. good execution.
kgshw14z4o,1756,"superb capture, just enough blurring to accentuate the movement and reinforce the frenzied activivity. the colour variations are an added bonus."
87pubsjdoq,1757,"wow. the image is really good, but perhaps id prefer to see it with more saturation. but, its my opinion."
5gma69nrv3,1758,"this is wild.but you can tell it was highly postedited. the shadows are unnatural and it give this image an almost d, surreal quality."
1wqhw526pt,1759,"im not sure if the motion blur was intentional or not, but imho, it would have been better without. other than that, excellent"
0as7wdakkr,1760,"wow, i really like this photo.good contrast and.cool guitar.lol"
4a6hnnt7hx,1761,"good image. perhaps, it would be better if you get to show more movement effect, but its a good picture."
pbpvren7aa,1762,photo is a bit dark for my taste.nice capture though.
g0ks05lfcj,1763,"wow, wow. its one of the best picture of this week. i love the effect of movement. furthermore, the colours are very beatiful. one of my favs."
y7jtpgbf5q,1764,portland? sure looks like it. just a bit dark but nice study just the same. good going.
y7jtpgbf5q,1765,a little dark. adjusting contrastlight would make this a bit better imho.
jp1el6wcbs,1766,"good idea. perhaps, id prefer to see it in colour and close. but just my opinion."
vrmzdtoj1z,1767,"might be my monitor, but a whiter whites gamma would work here."
3nnetuz8zi,1768,a little underexposed. you could probably adjust the levels and contrast and make this a working image
4jgc3qbnrv,1769,that is a great photo. good action as well as colour. its pleasing to look at.
4jgc3qbnrv,1770,daisys grow in the arctic? the photo is good quality.
5rh15g5269,1771,love blue angels in action great capture
t6l8if9tcq,1772,great capture! i think there might be too much saturation in the reds.
koxdqs3vz9,1773,like your colour choice . great idea!
koxdqs3vz9,1774,i like the blueish corporate tone to this photo.
uv2j54zcuf,1775,"great action! nice gritty finish to the photo, feels more like grain than noise and is very sutiable for an skateboarding photo."
uv2j54zcuf,1776,wonderful vantage point.hope you didnt get hurt.excellent in b and w and a nice amont of motion blur
a4hx48574g,1777,i like it! hazzy hot days of summer.action enough.
hgkq656m2y,1778,this doesnt say a lot of action to me. nice colors though.
8sju0dsgob,1779,"beautiful, but a little dark. hard to see details"
zbx5kfb21e,1780,"im just not seeing action here. its all frozen motion, no motion blur, nothing moving, just frozen."
pjd2hjzwk9,1781,"shame, you lost a lot of contrast in this, maybe the exposure was off and you have tried to rescue it"
rqy2w5v9n8,1782,i am happy to see more girls in action sports. love the faces. the photo needs some clarity and or sharpness.
kwujw75doi,1783,i like the colors. the rapid waves put alot of action in it!
crvhfsovl5,1784,awesome picture even the wings are sharp.
svtlt0j770,1785,just a tad too much motion blur going on here
w7bj0zft91,1786,funky compression of the image.
bxnwlfacdq,1787,thats a good photojournalism.great black white photo.
cc9xhi358w,1788,"incredibly fantastic. clar sharp, precise."
zkcteskyvp,1789,"shoulda waited for the stopped motion, ya woulda given me a good run."
l3ukfw51bf,1790,brilliant! great colors and action make this one of the best here.
ogo5brqj21,1791,"good capture. difficult, but just a little sharpermore definitionclarity, the colors perhaps tweaked"
by671yf8fj,1792,"like the idea. i think that it lacks crispness sharpness, and contrast."
scrq6gdp5z,1793,"this might have done better in the motion freeze catagory. there is implied action but no movement, no blur, nothing that says fast"
drdxqk5ptn,1794,"i think you forgot an h. just kidding! how old is to old to go down a slide anyway.i think i remember they were fun. the photo seems, not too dark but just not light enough or as bright as it could be. maybe a different time of day?"
eydg0bhzvr,1795,"action is ok, not really fond of the blue color cast."
39anv2afnt,1796,didnt get it?is the bang a shadow?
39anv2afnt,1797,the black and white contrast is good and the detail of the shadow of the fingers .
xpgqfqmvz2,1798,blur implies motion thats good. but too much blur over too much of the picture gets confusing and loses its effect.
45952rpgtv,1799,your track mates photo is much more appealing to me in bw
g8hqy7lui1,1800,very nice action capture little too grainy though.
ovghejbtg5,1801,almost got it. a little blurry but good otherwise.
swsezvzzfu,1802,"looks like you have edited the colors to make it this red, but cool silhouettes."
hu4iynp2u8,1803,nice idea but think your white balance needs correcting!
lc3ldti58z,1804,"very cute. its a bit busy, but i guess with all the colors it should be."
wxe18387dw,1805,"ooh, the color is so lovley!"
212cwl0n6x,1806,"great timing, sharp picture."
uik6ib4rnc,1807,"the red light is nice, but you need a lot more of it. the handarm is hidden in shadows."
i21lbm6gir,1808,"well composed photo too stopped motion for my taste, not much action."
ugwvab0j51,1809,"ooh, i love these lightning shots! this one is fantastic! i love the great color tones in this one! great photo!"
ugwvab0j51,1810,wow amazing capture. ive tried to get some lightning shots and its not an easy feat.
rd5bpikbq8,1811,artful and ethereal. maybe elsapo? great backlighting.
ihtqku05ee,1812,from me.awesome image excellent clarity and colors.
q66ttlg0km,1813,"bright light, bright light! cute photo."
tfazn3ofb8,1814,i like the idea of blured hands flying over the keys but youve overexposed this a bit too much in my opinion.
fg58r4czzk,1815,i can see a lot of work has gone into this but i just find it a little lacking in interest. great green colour
aiwsa4wz5n,1816,great capture! love the colors and sharpness in the mallards. the motion in the wings is an added bonus.
sjhdi4esye,1817,"a little bit confusing, dont know if it would look better in color, or maybe with a different bw conversion. ."
7zqsqbcrap,1818,nice capture. the bw treatment gives this photo an interesting feeling that i like.
etm8r1lfsq,1819,over saturated andor too heavy on the shadowhighlights sliders.
a4dgxhvded,1820,this is great execution of stopped motion. but i dont
ys3dt03h09,1821,"not for me. maybe in a motion blur photo, but not action. action ggenerally is about stopping something still, or almost, with the hint of movement. neither the idea or execution of this appeals to me."
xxovfgc4ms,1822,"got the gist, nice idea, but too dark for mine."
htnr9cqyix,1823,a little blurry but the content is excellent.
htnr9cqyix,1824,great choice for bw processing. very classic feel about it.
5flud5jj5x,1825,"harsh light, the hard shadows should be avoided. ."
uwrppyydmo,1826,it was an overprocessed nightmare. lol
uwrbw5pc7l,1827,"i like the over saturated feel of this, it really adds to the parched feeling of the photo"
5z2ruh898k,1828,great capture! shouldve taken the blue in my opinion. very nice!
cwcvrsljud,1829,thats gonna make a mess! cool capture.
zlmcdwldad,1830,"looks a bit too oversaturated or too much contrast or something, nice action in the photo tho"
xybk8ewbll,1831,"nice colors in your flames, the reds really make the flames stand out"
hsdiwwrxgn,1832,"i gave this a because i did not like the cool look, i think a natural hue would work better. id like to see also a little more contrast."
gzmpddqx2c,1833,real nice motion blur. i love the colors too.
6x10bt6pzw,1834,"very fun, very real, and love the burst of color against the monochrome."
nvjxb6a3wo,1835,there might be more to it but all im seeing are blurry lockers.
0ia7z1n8r3,1836,"a pretty neat capture, but the technicals of the image dont do much for me. i find it to be fairly dark, and processed in a strange way."
0ia7z1n8r3,1837,unfortunately the photo is pretty grey and fuzzy.
vbm3ymtny8,1838,this has a great feel of motion i really like it but i really dont like the boarder.
wga8zsshtb,1839,nice soft photo. nicely composed. like the choice of color treatment.
4bs4e12j14,1840,"gave this a , mainly because i like the image quality, a little boost in contrast perhaps and this could work as a commercial or something of the kind, nice job."
ptnlse2bur,1841,a lovely photo and appropriate sentiment. like the bw treatment very much.
t6e5ve7wgu,1842,love the saturated colours and great contrast. the grungy look adds mood.
1pxccnzu2r,1843,"i would like to see a different version of this, cuz its not your best work. its very grainy. its a cool idea though"
2l83ucmv8m,1844,adorable photo. wish the image didnt have such a yellow cast to it.
g3r21fsdxc,1845,"rikki it is just a smidge too dark, in that the illusion would be lost to those with poor calibrated monitors."
20o0cxwzkz,1846,"thats amazing, the coloring is awesome!"
20o0cxwzkz,1847,really fine photo. carefully planned. perfect for sepia.
20o0cxwzkz,1848,"not only does this photograph capture the essence of adulthood without adults, it is a very pleasing photo to look at.gives off a feeling of warmth. definately a seller!"
20o0cxwzkz,1849,"solid, deep, philosophic, mature, technicaly perfect bw."
20o0cxwzkz,1850,"like the tone and atmosphere,depiction good."
bpy2ulnm15,1851,what fabulous collection of momentos. well arranged for a very good photo. love the contrast.
l6a9ynkv8j,1852,"very touching, bw was a nice choice"
xe06h4g0y7,1853,"an impressive year youve had, my friend"
xe06h4g0y7,1854,very cute and so well balanced light wise.
tsywx0nddc,1855,im curious on how its doneremote control? dont laugh! good motion image
q23b6x1hzg,1856,nice capture with lovely warm tones.
v0vnkr7ezz,1857,absolutely gorgeous. how did you achieve this feel to your bw treatment?
v0vnkr7ezz,1858,noo! thats too dreary! great light! its got a fairy tale effect. works well.
q8wcb9rqbi,1859,"lol, and a very neat presentation that can not fail to win a chuckle."
q8wcb9rqbi,1860,"very nice, very true! counting and color coordinating the pills, great idea."
9qhbvuv868,1861,"funky white balance, but clever idea!"
lb6y04by0y,1862,"again, these are my own opinions and you should take it for what it is. its too bad that the image was underexposed. maybe a bit of pp would have helped this image."
dkp2i5mp5r,1863,a beautiful image david the softness is lovely and the pink wonderful
dkp2i5mp5r,1864,"very nice colors, excellent use of the soft contrast ."
27aui9ratm,1865,"theres something appealing about this photo for me.in the way it evokes memories of the disneyland electrical light parade, but for hot rodding adults!"
un1z78umrj,1866,"i really like the color, the texture, and the lines of this picture, but it just doesnt say adulthood to me."
rm426thp6i,1867,"ha ha! exactly! nice picture, love the sepia tones and the way you framed it with the trees."
90jn2y1204,1868,for some reason this reminds me of the movie dead ringers. great study in bw.
xf6b7lyvqa,1869,id have lost the droid at the front light that is very blurred.
a7go8zbxoh,1870,i like it.the light poles get in the way but you did a good job
cp2i5x4phr,1871,little black mark under the cavalier sign.
yg1co3tkal,1872,i hope to see more photos of this nature and quality from you and others in the future. great work.
ywt90omc8p,1873,cute idea and nice use of black and white.
3e6bdk1ufk,1874,nice compositioni really like the colors that the flowers add. the note is a nice touch
3e6bdk1ufk,1875,"wow, the colors are a bit washed for my liking, but other than that this is excellent."
gkpvcgu5jm,1876,"kids and peace are both priceless, but i dont think it is possible to sell either one well, maybe possible, probably not legal. anyway. good picture. the black and white really sets the mood well in this pic."
gkpvcgu5jm,1877,indeed priceless! beautiful bw study of a day in childhood. nice!
gkpvcgu5jm,1878,"cute idea and nice photograph, would love to have seen the peace symbols drawn in big black felt markers that would read more immediately, great choice of message to promote"
ljpeb8ofsl,1879,this is nice its clean and clear. my only nit is the name or shadow of a name at the bottom.
r8yvticcoe,1880,"nice idea, beautiful colors, but its a little noisy for my taste."
r8yvticcoe,1881,"very cool idea, nice and sharp focus.i see my pic"
jswjucdy0f,1882,well done recreation of a popular ad campaign. i love the colors.
jswjucdy0f,1883,this is really nice but the towl is a little overexposed.
jswjucdy0f,1884,"this is pretty good. would have been better with the actual snuggle soft bear, but theyre probably not easy to come by."
jswjucdy0f,1885,"nice idea, good colors, too much bright on the white."
8rdh3ju2qk,1886,this filter you use doesnt appeal to me. but i guess thats only my oppinion.
8rdh3ju2qk,1887,use indirect light to avoid the reflections.
i9mstkjfqz,1888,nice contrast with the colors. poor kitties.
oh72w65x6y,1889,the product is covered by the shadow! madison ave is safe.
ai2h63qwme,1890,nice use of backlighting . however the label is a little dark .
ai2h63qwme,1891,"great idea! its a shame its so dark, though."
ai2h63qwme,1892,"too dark, to see the brew bru."
o258nb5em2,1893,excellent photo. great detail and no light flares! very professional.
o258nb5em2,1894,"good detail, well lit, nice job"
o258nb5em2,1895,beautifull sharp and detailed photo with wonderfull reflections. well done!
8cfcjlarqn,1896,cute idea. but something is lost with so much blue.
1khwd2jiff,1897,a lot of contrast here. this pic might have looked better on a cloudy day.
g9rewj2a3c,1898,"you should have used sharpen, because this isnt the clearest it could be. otherwise a very nice setup, good job!"
67elxt0agb,1899,"a really nice picture, if a little oversharpened jaggies in the rigging show it best. cant for the life of me find a product here, though. whatcha selling?"
67elxt0agb,1900,"if i were convinced this was a product, this would be a ten. the photographic and compositional quality of this photograph is absolutely amazing. great exposure."
23xx867dfp,1901,this nice. pure. it seems technically flawless. but it isnt interesting.
7fwlwrv9f1,1902,mm i like these pops. nice setup and and a colorfull picture. the unsharpness at the bottom is kinda disturbing though.
dqyrjy5amz,1903,"is this for real? nice shot,perfect framing,and color."
cylfeuu1uv,1904,"very cool, the blue purple light makes this work even more for me."
cylfeuu1uv,1905,nice detail and use of light.
48mxxrl4tq,1906,"um. what is it? whatever it is, the colours are horrible. green and black, blech p"
ygz037q73v,1907,extremely difficult to light a picture like this correctly. probably the best result possible without professional equipment though.
2621clmwm9,1908,"eh. i seen no absolute, just an odd setup with hands."
1k36tcdwcv,1909,"i like the earthy feel youve given this photo. goes very well with the timberland products, but it all seems just a little too monotone for me. the socks especially are almost camouflaged"
qpfqtudf6j,1910,scary that atleast minds think that alike. great clarity and color. grat photo!
qpfqtudf6j,1911,great use of color and sharp foucus.
qpfqtudf6j,1912,"very cool idea, nice and sharp focus.i see my pic"
g284zk7dab,1913,"nice use of bw, i think ive seen a commercial like this, anway it is a nice twist"
g284zk7dab,1914,nice idea clever sidestep of colormatching issues by going grayscale.
g284zk7dab,1915,"if this really is an image on the screen arranged with real books, this is a technical masterpiece! im wondering why its in black and white."
6c25c8v65v,1916,"mm, looks good! i like the ambience of the light here, really makes the image come alive"
6c25c8v65v,1917,"this is a good pic, but there is something about the coloring of the cookies. i wish i could tell you how to do it different."
stmc1v668g,1918,just like the real michelob. flat!
8dtgisjtvz,1919,"hehheh, i must be tired cause i see all kinds of things in that orange slice. nice job."
kcp75wlv03,1920,i can hear the fizz! beautiful color and sharpness. nice job.
cdyl9t4cbv,1921,good call on using black and white it really enhances the oldfashioned feel of the photo.
stg2wvjzk3,1922,but you are the adult ! haha it was only a green one nice work.
jtxlvjcel0,1923,nice use of balck and white.
bwy0aq3kjw,1924,"ouch, nice layoiut. but it seems oversharpened a tad. too many artifacts and hard edges."
4j0d03ysv8,1925,ok. i have studied this for at least ten minutes and i am stumped! i can see how you would have gotten the words blurry
g6qz0p1t79,1926,colors are a little dull and dark
g6qz0p1t79,1927,"yum! nice placement, god choice of colors. a little dark."
g6qz0p1t79,1928,there is too much of a yellow hue to the photo
g6qz0p1t79,1929,"there seems to be a green tint to the picture, probably from the light source."
m0cs6vcn7e,1930,ive always had a problem reading the redonblack motif. maybe more contrast would help here.
m0cs6vcn7e,1931,"nice comp, good color, interesting."
n1oiff54tk,1932,i like the way you were able to show the contrast of the different shades of white gray without losing them.
7notmctqkw,1933,a fresher light source would work wonders for this image i feel.
7notmctqkw,1934,"sorry, i wouldnt eat that, doesnt look tasty. thats probably because you chose the wrong white balance"
0oze8iy6fx,1935,the compilation of all these colors makes for a very eyecatching photo.
tgqk2mmklj,1936,"all those smooth curves lost a lot in the downsizing to pixles. thats no shortcoming of the pic, though. nice work on this."
tgqk2mmklj,1937,love this photo! i had to look at it for a while to figure out what it was. i liked it even before i knew. very good exposure and contrast!
y69qe97dge,1938,"good idea, your white balance is way off though."
y69qe97dge,1939,good idea with the setup. perhaps a bit brighter would be better to give a more realistic coloring of the labels.
y69qe97dge,1940,"fun, but too much sepia"
jkft2ttm91,1941,beautiful colors and clear. well balanced. very nice.
jkft2ttm91,1942,nice color contrast nad variety.
pztwdshh28,1943,"the editing could be better, maybe a darker red or maybe no editing at all. cool picture though"
pztwdshh28,1944,a little dark but nice use of selective coloring.
2if1hg2fhy,1945,"i think this is a really good advertisment.the blue tones really give it a cold, cool feeling."
lkzlk6wdj5,1946,great idea! the yellow color seems a little fake to me.
lkzlk6wdj5,1947,the bright colors of the peeps really makes the picture stand out from all the others
schhmiemgh,1948,"great photo, very unique and dynamic looking just not sure this is about a product."
n9cflhmbgo,1949,"nice, smooth, inviting. luxurious presentation. good work."
p73ar5bobi,1950,"too dark, hard to see the watch. cant see the hands. the relection seems a too blown out."
p73ar5bobi,1951,"very slightly too dark, but beautiful effect. nice."
oyc1vc131m,1952,"good idea, but i think the photo is a little bland. could use a bit more color and pop."
oyc1vc131m,1953,the waves are a nice effect. classic corona pic.
onyj1lnvw5,1954,strangely phallic. lol. nice colors.
s43tmby9xd,1955,this picture is a bit blurry and bland.
et2l9lftrs,1956,"the whole picture is blurry, and isnt well lit at all. by adding more light it would make the picture easier to see."
8rl75dt85w,1957,"perfect, irene! i love how you always make these kinds of shots fresh and unique. this is really awesome."
8rl75dt85w,1958,"very appealing, makes me thirsty for earl grey tea"
hkaz0523le,1959,"this is really cute, i like how you only used red, white, and black. great d effect"
70593srvc2,1960,a little unglamorous. uninteresting and a bad light source.
9w6hkq7l10,1961,"your bw conversion and levels are very, very well done."
dnhoybx6yl,1962,"in this case, the motion blurs are a distraction."
qsrukiu4d7,1963,"this looks like a real advertisement! good work! u liek the balance of the models haie. i also like the use of blues, whites and brown."
qsrukiu4d7,1964,this is great! the only thing i dont like is her black bracelet.love everything else
dk2kk185w1,1965,this was excellentblue in my estimation. great muted color and texture.
pbwgpge9xo,1966,"good and well composed, but not quite enough punch in the colors to stand out."
pbwgpge9xo,1967,"the color doesnt work for me, not enough contrast, all of the objects seem to blend in to one another."
b1t4kd3paj,1968,here i like the muted color tones and clarity. i dont exactly understand the add though.
b1t4kd3paj,1969,my only complaint would be that i wish there was a bit more light on the spikes. it makes them very hard to see.
li1v14n9ec,1970,very basic but definitely conveys the message. the blue is very vibrant against the black.
li1v14n9ec,1971,nice condensation and glow to this. perfect against the dark bkd.
cd1kym689l,1972,i like that the tone gives it that old time western feel
z1occozw4t,1973,i like the bw and grain treatment for this one.very nice.
6zsrf8gr2t,1974,shadow on label on brand name
x5ahjynqrh,1975,a bit overexposed and could do with extra contrast i think as it dosent seem to have good detail.
vztwu2rbf9,1976,"that would make a great ad for the skyshow. great colors, looks very festive."
xvzfruhnas,1977,terrific photo in every way. a blue for sure.
vwttwrea9f,1978,a little overexposed but nice look to the add
fv5maeh8gk,1979,"very nice, perhaps a little extra contrast might give the image more impact."
kvcdmdmdvd,1980,"very good, you really have experience in dp. and the picture compesate between black and whites a ,"
aqa5wkwxs2,1981,nicely lit and exposed. im not sure the colorization works well for me may be better if the tool itself was its real color.
aqa5wkwxs2,1982,"i should be able to see the imprint on the tool better. there is a bit too much shadow around the tool. not a bad effort, though."
h9xrbtmwcy,1983,ahh the watch itself is superbly displayed and lit. the backgrould would be far better if it were a solid black this one doesnt do it justice. your models fingernail colors dont help a bit. even with the flaws mentioned its an excellent advertisement image.
4injpf9jra,1984,"light not great, would have maybe been better to have seen delighted expressions on peoples faces."
3gz617zdmg,1985,"slightly fuzzy, tad dark."
yj4y2d4tmb,1986,i dont like the soft edges.but a good photo over all
xiz1yh5akj,1987,good idea but looses a little defination and the white is a bit hard on the eyes.
mjf34xfmrq,1988,i feel the essence of the product is lost here. looks like a kia parked near a porsche dealership. neat picture though.
lbb20r3ykx,1989,"great colour, however is a bit unstructured."
bohvsol4e2,1990,very clever. you could work for an ad company. the photo itself looks just a bit flat though a boost to the color saturation would help.
lce8qgh737,1991,"excellent picture, very good incident light."
lce8qgh737,1992,a bit tilited youve capture the mood with the blue monochrome.
xuk8dgl6np,1993,nicely done. i like the tones and the contrast of the dark trees behind.
jsb0niwehx,1994,"i dont really see the advertisment quality. for one thing, i dont know what is being advertised. generic candles?"
jsb0niwehx,1995,great colours and good light. i liek the over exposed parts too. that make this so much more intresting then a a perfect exposure woul do.
7o9pn0e730,1996,wow. thats a lot of bugs. color balance seems off.
xezka1gg8p,1997,has an almost s ad feel to it.maybe its the colors.
cqtec6pa87,1998,i dont think having the photograph all the same tone does it justice.
cqtec6pa87,1999,"an advertisement for orange glo should probably have some vivid orange in it. so im not much for the color of the picture, but the setting is nice."
cqtec6pa87,2000,"i like the colour. probably i never see an advertisement in sepia, but i really love your pic."
tzuqk05r75,2001,"do you know that when i first saw it on the screen at work, i jus saw the n and didnt know excactly theat ad was for! so, good but perhaps too much contrast."
tzuqk05r75,2002,"oh, this loosk good, yammi great light, very warm. maybe your should have shown a bit more of teh label, so one could guess what it says."
apaq8ajw2s,2003,that looks tasty. i wish the label was not so overexposed and easier to read. still looks yummy.
sz5mbnmxzu,2004,its got beautiful colors it would look better if it were a lil bit closer to axually c details.but it looks good gr job
agt2lpjr0u,2005,"interesting, colorful, and a well done photo!"
agt2lpjr0u,2006,lol this is one of the better of the pictures ive seen all morning the colors r so pretty.lol.goodluck
olide9mzyu,2007,a little dull but the red pointer thingy adds a splash of color.
f08lbengo4,2008,many cufflinks make light work?
29cje8n6ld,2009,the colors seem a little cool for the tropical message
nqko54x9ee,2010,"great job! not too dark, not too light. now i crave chips."
52nacaucbc,2011,its a bit overexposed and lacks punch in the colour for some reason. maybe if the contrast was increased a bit it would have helped.
rmzxi5o54m,2012,"green, and more green. good coloring through all the beans, not too much shadow. well done."
rmzxi5o54m,2013,clever idea and good picture but it seems a little dark to me.
j80nzm0r2w,2014,"very nice work! the pastel colors and the clarity, just perfect on this!"
j80nzm0r2w,2015,"very nice soft atmosphere to complement the product, good arrangement as well."
3ng7mahkih,2016,"great idea, but the overexposed highights ruin it for me."
y30bbc961c,2017,really nice color and clarity. this could be an actual ad. great job!
lyqk0gt7ii,2018,try adjusting the saturation a bit in photoshop.
lyqk0gt7ii,2019,"i like the idea. if you can somehow bring out the light a bit more, it would make the picture more bolder"
lyqk0gt7ii,2020,"nice colors. though its hard, it might look better if no smeared ss, no reflections in the skittles, and all the ss turned the same way. of course, i dont expect you to be perfect. great job with what youve done"
1cl29mvbje,2021,now thats what i need. love the use of the different coloured screws. really effective.
7uxbusnyrw,2022,"great idea, but the colors seem to fadded or mute. this should be an explosion of color. nice collection by the way"
7uxbusnyrw,2023,someone had to . seems a little underexposed . pun not intended .
c9faqciwu7,2024,"not really an ad i can see catching on. nice sharpness, not so great ad."
ey1cuwfzee,2025,the technical problems in this image overwhelm the good idea. youve got the zaggities. this is usually caused by over compression.
hoylgz71h2,2026,"excellent. great contrast and detail. not sure how you got the desat within the rules, but i trust you."
5472rjqz9d,2027,"this looks so juicy. i love the orange on blue ok, its my personal choice in color combos! i think i need to go eat an orange now."
inzw5lvojb,2028,i like the clarity and the way the light hits this.
9bu255f7u6,2029,"vibrantly pink! powerful message in the color, just so vivid."
9bu255f7u6,2030,its a lil uneven but its an awesome picture u did a great job
8q6fvj6ubw,2031,"funny, cute, and gorgeous colors too."
xf1ulb29o0,2032,"awesome pov. clear, sharp and noise free. terrific photo."
2rbiyr0gpc,2033,"nice idea, image could have been sharper, shadows are a little offputting."
x889ncfzz4,2034,very contrasty. lacks saturation.
x889ncfzz4,2035,"to overexposed so it has lost a lot of its crispness, maybe play with the contrast a bit more."
x889ncfzz4,2036,contrast seems a bit dark. nothing overly interesting to portray the hats though.
x889ncfzz4,2037,"the images is overexposed my monitor is very preciesly calibrated, and lacks a punch."
vf2wv7yhoz,2038,sorry but its quite blurry and really dosent look appealing!
wnvgt9sere,2039,wow! a little dark imho.
0x09wqamfg,2040,im not sure what im looking at. i think there glasses. a photo that is sharp yet still unreconizable is a keeper. nicly done
h0mz7afq2t,2041,i like the picture but i dont care for the color
a401etva5h,2042,a great parade of wow colors.
1aa7thbb57,2043,i really like the tone in the bw. good conversion.
u0elbnzfa6,2044,"this is an interesting photo, however technically i feel it is to flat. no whits no blacks just gray."
u0elbnzfa6,2045,why is there a toyota amongst the vipers? this must have looked great in color. i would add a bit of contrast and some usm to make this a sharper image. imho.
kfk289xhoe,2046,this is such a beautiful serene image.funny how red and pink really go together and the model is so beautiful as well.
kbi8la2clf,2047,wow! does someone actually live here? very nice balance and exposure is perfect.
qlz3wbiabz,2048,hmm. are those brown roses?
07fzm8956m,2049,too much sharpening. also looks like you took the pic during mid day which gives it a washed out effect. next time try using softer light in either the morning or afternoon.
ywunzswie2,2050,"good light, nice balance. my boss needs a poster of this."
jrl3b2hx3o,2051,a bit too much noise here for my taste.
dqpgpgjnu0,2052,"well done good composition,lighting,sharpness,use of black white"
84o3w3dl0r,2053,also it looks a tad bit overexposed as there is not much detail in the matchsticks.
yfx9t37s1c,2054,"i thought this was very clever i wish there were rays of light coming out of the case, light the starburst, not possible in basic though so i wont hold it against you"
p9vdck48zs,2055,the red cast to the pictures makes me think of sweeney todd
qzdb6rnyew,2056,"nice job! i love the fabrick texture, lol"
qzdb6rnyew,2057,the watch faces are not iluminated properly. theres hot spots in some arears and its to dark in other areas. also the watch bands seem to be kinked in some spots.
p2x82iaa4c,2058,a little bit more sharpness would make this picture better. nice use of sepia
rep0uo49rf,2059,a very good capture with biting texture.
q6d4swain3,2060,idea is good but its all too clean and neat.
ajyj5tlj3p,2061,"it seems i have failed thus far to mention how much i like this picture youve managed to create something both dark and delicate, which i find very hard to do."
ajyj5tlj3p,2062,nicely done. he black nail polish is a great touch good job on keeping the reflections off the rings
ajyj5tlj3p,2063,"good job, dark and imho a very cool pic. hope it dose well."
ajyj5tlj3p,2064,"i like the textures, the bw and the general feel of the photo. very sharp, too."
ja70z03d0j,2065,"lights a little flat, needs to pop a bit more. great idea and modeling. ."
ja70z03d0j,2066,"if this photo would have been taken in a more sepia tone. then i would have given it a but, its still a good picture for the topic."
v4bkl5t4jp,2067,good detail and the splash of blue makes it.
8ild2y2h0t,2068,very cool idea. such neat balance.
8ild2y2h0t,2069,too blue for my taste i would have worked the white balance a little. like the idea though!
5yhzup914s,2070,this is really unique not often does anyone try stretching our imaginations. great job!
8v17ouufdp,2071,"push that saturation, green greens and red reds would make this a more appetizing photo"
j8txxxj0ag,2072,"great image, colors and all are very nice. maybe it would be nicer for the image if the driver would get out."
6abbaxy78o,2073,"the cloudy day very much detracts from the affluence, and from the impact of the image"
o5kpptjzkx,2074,coloring seems a little off. even the red bricks have quite the blue tint to them.
8ml80ti8i8,2075,"nice idea, good to see there isnt jewellry or dollars everywhere, quality is a bit poor"
8ml80ti8i8,2076,"image needs to be larger. nice colors, i guess."
if4fvq7znd,2077,"great ambience here, the picture itself could be a little brighter though. ."
if4fvq7znd,2078,"beautiful picture. for some reason, i like blue pictures."
87sqvhn58s,2079,i really like this.the image has a great photojournalistic quality about it.the b w was an excellent choice.
87sqvhn58s,2080,i like this alot. the dogs add to the interest. good use of black and white. different i like it.
34ss19jijj,2081,this has a nice quality. very soft but firm. the grain adds to the richness of this image. nice.
rozk81m0tw,2082,very cool. nice colour also. suits it well
ypq6gs4dhg,2083,i think rich color would convey a rich feel better than black and white.
9bb2cpvobl,2084,very dramatic. like the light quality. cant  really tell if its black and white or color. nice job.
6e5f9uvzws,2085,the red on her lips looks amazing! nice work.
jsywoolmd8,2086,lovely red hot and a very cool drive.
8nd83xo2tn,2087,"impressive, lovely and the upkeep very expensive. for that jazzy and wild look!"
0bm27utlzv,2088,its a little flat needs a bit more oomph! sharpening might help
imhguwuv1i,2089,"nice effort, i like the idea and generally this is a good effort. the white balance seems unnatural to me. it has a decidedly yellowish cast that really hurts it for me."
2kw0wwy22s,2090,a classic take on the topic.
9czdbxv0sx,2091,i guess this is an exlusive club. the photo looks a little soft and the upject is relatively uninspiring
0j3e2c0y52,2092,"this is an amazing capture, the detail is impeccable and the colors simply beautiful. i gave you a based on the quality of the image. id be curious to know what organization or individuals built this observatory and how it is being used."
ys4b2rlwxs,2093,very rich colors and textures. nice capture.
eu952impkz,2094,"lol! a bit too contrasty for my taste, but wonderful idea."
2xi0y3wllj,2095,"very successful reflections and good color, nice capture"
2xi0y3wllj,2096,very beautiful colours. good quality image for sure.
sqq2uju5hx,2097,possibly a little shorter exposure would have created less blown areas. still a very nice image.
1xk9gab0ik,2098,what light there is reflecting off off the wet rocks makes this photograph captivating. nice levels of blue throughout. .
1xk9gab0ik,2099,is is a better photo in the dark as aposed to earlier morning sunrisesunsit?
2bilhfwtj6,2100,very nice.beautifully soft lighting.very good use of light and shadow.
ldn0qsihf5,2101,"a more than interesting creation with a poignant balance between discernable detail and spectral ambiguity, which, to me, translates to magic."
owvarq35f6,2102,amazing patterns of light flare. good picture.
elbbqbmkpw,2103,i think this definitely fits the bill of being something thats more interesting because its taken in the dark.
n77sk635mh,2104,really good choice with the blue tones
q8zpo7oczm,2105,a bit too soft and maybe a touch underexposed.
zy8a76mi84,2106,"i really like this, even the bright spots shinings through the gaps in the lampshades, makes it look like a ufo."
fkes8qf6s1,2107,highly artistic. color tint is great.
fkes8qf6s1,2108,"very nice. i love spiders, my wife hates them. awesome. great appearance of natural transparency."
j8mdgbbwv5,2109,terrific. just found this one. the blue is so rich. great photograph all the way around.
j8mdgbbwv5,2110,the stars are so beautiful in this photo. i love the blue tones.
o4tzuo2thh,2111,"i think in postprocessing you oversharpened this a bit. i think this because on the curves of the r, jagged lines are visable, rather than keeping a nice smooth edge."
1vvsoq1yd5,2112,definitely more interesting after dark. pic could have been more detailed maybe if it was larger?
384zxy7y55,2113,if i didnt know you entered this in after dark i wouldnt even know it was a night time photo.
wxljl3kbpi,2114,very well down. excellent use of color throughout. so much worth seeing in one photo. .
rmhzyyv3a3,2115,a superb image beautiful colour and tones
d38sp89uda,2116,"nice and sharply done! it might have been a little more dramatic to increase the contrast just a tad, but still a good job."
1j1zetqm2a,2117,nice contrasts and colors. sharpness is nice too.
oth6gyavjo,2118,"i like the colorful cast to this image, and your use of motion blur is effective."
r42f5fzfh3,2119,the streak effect is great. i would have liked to see a bit more exposure andor more striaks.
oq7yes4irt,2120,an intersting duotone very well caught with the ciggie glowing. an
oq7yes4irt,2121,i love the orange glow amid the cold blue.
o1sojp9iw2,2122,woohoo! my st yellow! its about time!
c0etle05et,2123,this looks english i like the blackand white effect on this
ksbc91ov5u,2124,great colors here and a different take than most of the other photos ive seen. i like the movement in this picture. but are they looking at shoes? good job.
sw3c2orxbn,2125,im really not sure what this is i like the colour buta little more detail may have helped
1q792y9fwi,2126,"nice capture, but would prefer to see more of far detail and less of near."
vdb2l9a94j,2127,nice idea. looks like the mother moved a bit during the exposure causing her to blur
vdb2l9a94j,2128,how do you get a clear ghost with no signs of movement going or coming from crying person?
bceipbz39q,2129,neat lights and colors here. if it only could have been just a little bit sharper.
bceipbz39q,2130,personal cool photo! love the colors and reflections.
e0jpdu8tya,2131,"this has mystery, welcome, heightened awareness, and wonderful texture. the use of light also works well. a very dense and intriguing image."
e0jpdu8tya,2132,"good composition,great use of light and shadow"
3of6pxsyo4,2133,"a good idea, but doesnt quite work for me too grey. i dont know how you could have made it any better."
ok8lx54x5g,2134,"good shot.i love the capture of all the lights.the color is good, and i like the motion of the smoke.nice job"
ok8lx54x5g,2135,whoa. this is awesome! you did an amazing job w the exposure here. simply stunning.
qsbm14nnr8,2136,nice use of colors and sharpness is wonderful.
d0id1mc29o,2137,"very nice, unfortuante that the far edge of the falls are a tad overexposed."
ygjfgzwn0h,2138,i love the peacefulness of this photo! excellent job!
054e64gyt6,2139,seems a bit overdone with ni but the colors are great!
a2glis5iac,2140,"great image, id be curious to a see different duotone, something warm representing the heat of hell, edit on second glance, this is wonderful"
kp2s9dc0up,2141,"i really like the colors, theyre vivid and lively but at the same time they have a sullen feel."
7s040ee4lm,2142,"i dont get the meaning, and the image is all grainy."
7s040ee4lm,2143,"reall nice image, a bit noisy, but still really nice."
3khi389zm5,2144,very cool might have added a touch more red for that hellish feel.
8ldmd2x06h,2145,"the first idea isnt always the best. sharp, but underexposed."
abbg0cauxk,2146,interesting use of colour and blurring
18k5wz7b4g,2147,blur looks a little strange. still a moving picture
18k5wz7b4g,2148,"very nice idea. well done. personally, i dont like the blur on the figure but it does show him going so ill let you off! very well done"
h4rlpc4n9v,2149,catching colors and sharp details. hope this one does well.
qvfrf06403,2150,"the colors look weird to me. correct me if im wrong, but is it too much shadowhighlight?"
aj1nzncaj8,2151,you could think metaphysically quite alot about this but i dont like black as a picture.
h9l313r3gu,2152,dramatic! great capture of color. flat looking. real?
smsyrw8124,2153,the greyscale is a bit flat. needs a bit more contrast.
y3zl4yxaek,2154,"a great idea, but the resolution of hte picture is too poor."
wz8b2z7pp7,2155,good picture and good quote. its a little too pink and purple.
6nohyrf462,2156,"good idea and i like the choice of coloring, makes it feel a bit more mysterious."
jvkuo5q7ok,2157,your setup is also very impressive. good work.
u2elbg2ifb,2158,this is nice. wish the power poles were absent. would pale blue help? i like the bw.
u2elbg2ifb,2159,perfect and excellent use of the replace color tool i am assuming that is how you changed the green to the fantasticly impacting white
jdqu0t548d,2160,id like to see more contrast with light and dark. but its a great photo
xkzicgvwa0,2161,nice effect with the light. is that a real peson?
uuhkyp597x,2162,beautiful image! love the color combinations provided by nature. very serene
uuhkyp597x,2163,the orange hues.the neat image.could this be rikki?
hbkz8981k5,2164,bit too dark for me literally. id like to see just a bit more of persons faceexpression.
oawusf7at2,2165,"nice colage ,i like the idea ,the colors are wicked and give the photo just that hounted chill."
c16gqa0yoo,2166,contrast is rather dull comp is nice
gwvqslfvy5,2167,very interesting use of shadow and tone. well done
wpsewu08iq,2168,very interesting use of blurring and a good idea
3r7e3iulte,2169,"you blasted out the contrast and saturation just a bit too much, even so the image isnt that great"
7cpmmhme95,2170,"it is a great photo, the only thing i disliked was the flaring off the light."
su6n0hkg4o,2171,"a little more contrast would have made this image really pop, but then again you may not have been going for that at all.kind of the subtle effect maybe?"
x70wz01pvs,2172,interesting use of object and colour. a very nice photograph with lots of potential.
yfhs0gz4ua,2173,"hey, ive seen this one already. except the screen was all black."
yfhs0gz4ua,2174,"first all black, now all white. not much to judge, eh? a little blown out? ha, ha."
yfhs0gz4ua,2175,"naturally if we have photos of black images, we have to have one of a white image. i wonder if we die we discover that the afterlife is polkadot."
yfhs0gz4ua,2176,"good work. at least its white not black for photograpical merits though, rated"
yfhs0gz4ua,2177,"ok we had pure black ,now we have pure white ,oh the possibilities ."
yfhs0gz4ua,2178,"much like the completely black image, i have to say there is no image here to rate, sorry."
yfhs0gz4ua,2179,not as gutsy as the all black pictures.
hih92voade,2180,"the flames are a little too bright for my liking, id prefer them with more colour."
fey4cvbldj,2181,you need bigger to compete! nice colors. you get one bump for nice effort.
q9o003agr9,2182,colours of trees are gorgeous red!
b2z9dphlmd,2183,"dude, you broke out the super nin! classic!"
r0ai6gus2e,2184,"lightingprocessing good choice for bw here, im guessing."
f24iqolg86,2185,"i absolutely love this picture! one of my photographic obsessions in clouds, another is ripples. together with the vivid colors, this photo should be a winner!"
njukod4za3,2186,"pretty cool image, erick. i wonder whether itd be possible to lighten the shadow some?"
njukod4za3,2187,great opportunity here.in an empty stadium. the shadow adds interest which wouldnt normally exist in such a vast stadium
wfynmi2h4j,2188,"very interesting photo. perhaps a touch dark for my taste, but its really nice."
wfynmi2h4j,2189,"i like the colour and the repetition, but its a little too dark and it looks like it might have a bit of noise on it too?"
wfynmi2h4j,2190,"a bit dark for my screen.mm but good job, a"
wfynmi2h4j,2191,nice idea! a bit too dark imho.
wfynmi2h4j,2192,"this is a great idea, but it is so dark i cant really see the tops of the chairs."
nx45gjv169,2193,"i really like this. the bw works well, gives it more feeling of lonliness and emptiness."
nx45gjv169,2194,"very evocative of loss, of failure. i like. great use of light."
3l1n42o1sh,2195,interesting image would prefer a bit more contrast but thats a matter of personal taste.
mgkbmtm3mc,2196,this rather hints a before the game not after the uniform is too clean and he seems to tidy and composed.
t18ywvcig2,2197,great pov and the colours are almost perfect just a bit dark on the floorboards as id love to see the detail in them
qqtiydwu51,2198,needs.more.light.for the love of god.its just a little to dark i gave it a though would have been if there was just a pinch more light.
qqtiydwu51,2199,"im sure you went with the darkness to set the tone, but personally i would like to see a little more of the child.just personal preference."
bvkhrsxjbi,2200,"there is no mood here its just kinda boring, more effort is needed."
7tu4d0t4p2,2201,the bw effect really adds to the political statement that i think you are trying to make here. great pic.
qi0dpx7u4g,2202,good capture. a little dark on the bottom
prawwscnyj,2203,"interesting.good you told me that was a zamboni though. now, a slower blur and viola!"
g3aen27y6v,2204,beautiful violet color! love all the lines!
9wqrjwfcbw,2205,"extremely noisy. bad colors where i live those stripes are white, not pink."
9wqrjwfcbw,2206,"cool color, but i cant tell its at a sporting venue."
af6ud1d4yw,2207,"wrestling i presume? good color, u earned a anyway"
a24v633rwk,2208,good comp. i like the colours. the yellow redbrown and white.
a24v633rwk,2209,i love the contrast of dark vs light seats!
yib9abnv37,2210,details seem a little soft somehow. maybe a little too bright is the issue. not sure.
w33d7nn1yo,2211,"cute, flash is very uneven on my monitor"
ra501oct9k,2212,"theres something aggressive about this picture that is unsettling and that can be a good thing depending on what the photographer is trying to say this doesnt say tease to me, it says payback time. a provocative capture, either way. black and white might have been cool to use"
ra501oct9k,2213,"i wish this photo had a highter contrast, it would have looked awesome, anyway a"
xd90m2tll9,2214,"great peaces you have! nice quality and colors, sharpening is almost abouve max"
3ar4ghmu6y,2215,"you can actually feel the tenderness, warmth and love this mother has for its young one."
dij6uyi2h9,2216,"its a nice all around photo but to me, there is nothing to hold my interest. the black and white conversion i think is a good choice. i do think the photo could be a little sharper"
q0b9opza8y,2217,i love your outofthebox thinking. nice colors too.
wupxywxmy5,2218,unfortunately i cant see the hug just a dark blur.
wupxywxmy5,2219,not quite working. i think the reason is partly that it is difficult to see the hugger because the black hairs are merging somewhat. im guessing a lot of dpcers will not like the graininess. personally i quite like grain and blur but generally when done to the extent of this photo it works better bw
1syyg3v0w9,2220,great capture. real nice light too.
2htlrgl92k,2221,"was the blur intentionnal? at first i found it disturbing, but after a longer look, it gives the picture a soft and dreamy look"
st3s6blaru,2222,nice tonality and lights. sweet expressions.
wixys45s6p,2223,the colour cast really doesnt work. should try editing the white balance.
uo5z8n6x4e,2224,this leaves me wondering if it was a real reunion because she looks truly happy. great image. others may kill you for blurriness but the feeling conveys a lot.
3d6i8p6wtr,2225,"stunning, masterful night bw. front page for sure."
53k6exsa9x,2226,i really like what you did with the colors here. gives the image a bit of mystery.
pbvhbml740,2227,very cool colors here. must be either late evening or early morning.
5728peuhfk,2228,beautiful vivid colors and lovely fine detail.
vzybpotmhn,2229,"cool , bw idea is perfect, great one,"
zig5qojn1m,2230,a tad more contrast might have made this pop a bit more and really jump off the page
3eu09w4wra,2231,i love the detail in the card.good work.
mqcwxiuyc8,2232,c is for colors.great texture too.
aws95n352x,2233,neat looking place. great for vacation.

7f59ahv6u0,2235,whoa! what is this thing? and where is this? amazing photograph! great use of the light!
nm3cup5b1g,2236,"i like it, though perhaps it comes off a touch heavy on the tonemapping."
9afo7eor2c,2237,"i really like the lines created by the branches, and the bits of light streaming through is really nice too."
9afo7eor2c,2238,very nicely done bw conversion. lovely against the light capture.
we0evj3ivm,2239,funny. dont know about the selective desat. this is going to be one of those lovehate elements.
yq4xn8kmn7,2240,"where, is this a trick, if we fix the expose settings does heshe appear."
00ficqcj0t,2241,"nice image.good tone, sharp. i like it!"
00ficqcj0t,2242,"nice color and detail, good job avoidingeliminating any reflections."
dnte6asg10,2243,wonderful representation.a mind unraveling. fantastic photograph. my pick for the blue.
v4o05xeo70,2244,very cool. so cool. that touch of red and green is great.
e1cckqvkvm,2245,this might have benefitted from some noise reduction. i love the color on the wings!
lzxob1hu28,2246,you have captured my mood perfectly sick with a second cold in months heh heh
ckr89ypr3i,2247,he looks like that dude from twilght! lol. good bw
x8vb0m275s,2248,be sure to bring lots of warm clothes
x8vb0m275s,2249,"not much i can find wrong with this pic. actually it is fantastic. wonderful pastel tones, and the layering effect is awesome ."
vdgkx5e8rk,2250,"i have no idea why this pic is dark on ur screens, it looks fine on mine."
vdgkx5e8rk,2251,"really like the idea here. maybe it is my screen, but the image is very dark and grainy."
vdgkx5e8rk,2252,i wish it was a bit brighter and less grainy.
2hgnmoe4w0,2253,i like the color contrast and the treatment of light and shadows.
3es4du4i43,2254,"i think i have a guess on who took this one. the building is a good contrast for this picture, but i dont think its a better picture because of it."
iv1kmtl9qb,2255,beautiful pastel effect. nice work!
j89tu1xyc3,2256,sedona? southern utah? maybe northern az? nice color saturation and great clarity.
j89tu1xyc3,2257,"this photo feels like it has been oversharpened, which is a huge shame as it is fantastic in every other way."
xjkwdpymqj,2258,very nice! a harmonious balance populated yet at peace something humans should take note of how we learn from nature
xjkwdpymqj,2259,beautiful color.wonderful contrast! i love the way you captured the singleness of the tree.great job! .
owcifr2xj6,2260,this one would have been great for the shadow chalenge.
rvw14yz7id,2261,great vision and execution. incredible texture. great idea.
402psekb9x,2262,"the yellow leaves seem a bit overexposed it is almost hard to look at, they are too bright, maybe this would have worked better in black and white.just a thought."
3dv7312a20,2263,touching image. bw works well here. exposure is great no flash hot spots. great detail.
8rbvc1us2d,2264,"funny, bright and well staged. good light except for the blown highlights."
8rbvc1us2d,2265,"usually i am not very fond of pictures of toys, but this totally different, very clear and bright and well composed. i like it a lot! ."
cnrpnxffoa,2266,i like that the full status is only visable in the shadow.
myn1ps44ny,2267,i like the color balance a lot! nice work!
n3a1d5k6yl,2268,nice black and white shot.definately has a lonely feel to it.

trbaz9woni,2286,"nice, sharp rednition of the frogs brilliant colors."
3mvw4t86jj,2287,this guys been to a lot of my picnics. love the texture and detail you captured.
4aqkisf9ac,2288,theres definitely solitude. seems a little contrasty though. the highlights are a little blown out and the shadows perhaps a little too dark.
p98po2ugat,2289,i like the idea. you should have worked with the setup and i think it would have had better impact in color.
pir1ewg641,2290,coveys quiet solitude perfectly. great colors.
pir1ewg641,2291,gorgous shot.love the textures and the colors. nice work!

hga3vg9gk1,2294,the red ax stands out as the lonely being here. interesting.
0woxpfd0lo,2295,"i like the color treatment here, but the greyscale makes the leaves look muddy and dull."
0woxpfd0lo,2296,brilliant i just love this one. the red in bw backgrounds works perfectly. good job.
0woxpfd0lo,2297,wow. love the d feeling to this as well as the use of colour.
qfw9ujdx9q,2298,beautiful color and mood. its really the color that does it.
fjl8pzjvm9,2299,"good pointsnice technical picture, well developed and nice shadow."
wzylt5sqry,2300,such wonderful clarity to this photo! the black and white definitely add to the mood of this photo. nicely done!
gsfy3zdlfd,2301,"nice color contrast, but not a particularly compelling image."
z5m1x67jb5,2302,nice colorsa bit fuzzy though
w8597l58fb,2303,very beutiful colors and i also like the contrast between light and darkness. a better than usual use of a siluette.

1zopxkghbm,2305,"a little dark maybee, but it has a lonsome feeling i like anyway"

2gmz4vuj9r,2308,would be nice if it was a little closer to see more detail on the soldier.cute idea.
s8kz73j7ib,2309,this is an amazing image. is it converted from colour? clouds or smokesteam?
8e0m2lgt8d,2310,i ilke the vectors and treatment of light.
g9gt41loao,2311,very nice puts me in mind of the classic greek tragedy theatrical masks.
mtn44eetml,2312,blue on the houses looks oversaturated.isnt a very interesting shot.sorry.
mcw7qbeomp,2313,nice use of colours and bw.
mcw7qbeomp,2314,i really like how the reddish leaves look against the grays and earthy tones.
m3ibvoayo0,2315,very attractive portrait good layering and use of natural light.
t2l80dch6b,2316,"thats great. i know im over analyzing but i like that while the books are very obviously foreign to one another, there is a common color of blue. that brings them together along with the fact that they are both books and both are written."
ssq4v1te99,2317,"nice work, the light and shadow work well, well done"
ssq4v1te99,2318,i like the hard light used to cast the dark shadows. it gives the image a lot of feeling.

yuc3uf4hkj,2320,nice arragements of color and good representation of air
0sld6c4we8,2321,wow! the colors on this are phenomenal.makes me wish i was there to see this myself! absolutely stunning! great big fat !
y2d21wawdu,2322,"johanna, it is a picture of one of my pictures. more attenuating circumstances. but i understand the controversy. should have made it clear somehow and not light candles to an idol."
s6qzqac4ga,2323,quality stock still life.
35vlzz95j2,2324,nailed the processing that you needed to help. the white balance is the biggest issue.creative!

53x33f6t16,2326,well deserved finish. one of your s. superb noncomic like hdr. thats how they should look. added to fave.
bl6qu8y1f6,2327,"nice collection of light you got there, steve. well placed elements."
yg3hvzuzhl,2328,this image needs a little more contrast perhaps some color to separate the pieces? its difficult to tell what the pieces are.
dy6jwdc2ph,2329,love the fact that this is not a bw conversion.love the feel.
dy6jwdc2ph,2330,"dreamlike, lovely bw, wonderful to have the blurred edges with such amazing sharpness along some of the trees."
dy6jwdc2ph,2331,making me dizzy! lol! wonderful blur! from me!
huyceh2o7d,2332,good use of grain. nice conversion.
wdbc7rvtk7,2333,"very grainy and dull, needs more work with levels and curves"
wdbc7rvtk7,2334,thats a lot of boxes i wonder if a bit more contrast in the image would give it a bit more pop
wp45a3x7ed,2335,"this is one of your best visionary images, its very well done and has a wonderful illustrative quality about it."
9fb9g44izs,2336,"thats pretty cool, and i like the subtle streaks of color."
tpxftde3t7,2337,"please define real. those lights have filaments, they provide illumination, hence they are real. ok, i know im being a smartbutt."
w5ry0ww22l,2338,nice colors above the sharp mountains.
zhn3ejinxk,2339,"impressive. more work than i would do on decorating. the photo itself could use some adjustments levels, curves, etc. to really bring out all the wonderful details in this setup."
m3n44l0gun,2340,"well, the detail youve captured on this looks really yummy, but on my screen there is a yellowgreen color cast to the whole image, which does not make it look appealing. perhaps a white balance problem? otherwise this is pretty good."
irui613mqs,2341,"nice, i like the bw here. the soft tones put this photo in a dream."
ahvyfjznd8,2342,"beautifully composed, superbly seen, perfect control of tonality and texture, deep shadows. wow."
be5evs4o3w,2343,"think youll get your wish? yeah, i know. beautiful, sparkly is that glitter on the icicles, or a trick of the light?"
ss9v594eru,2344,"good light, contrast, guess i like some of the other subjectshots a little better.but not a bad idea."
nas8jpcm88,2345,oohh! me too! me too! nice use of selective desat.
k0czbi97i8,2346,i like the fantasia like feeling of your white christmas wish. good job.
k0czbi97i8,2347,beautiful colors here. nice exposure and processing.
k0czbi97i8,2348,"like the colors and the tone of this image, more sharpness was better."
h7ckw3xbo2,2349,lovely image and lovely sentiment
h7ckw3xbo2,2350,"nice image, good choice the bw"
w3f78z8lkr,2351,looks like you already have your white christmas
w3f78z8lkr,2352,awesome! my kind of white christmas!
w3f78z8lkr,2353,"wonderful. love the selective color. i would have liked to see the color in the windows as well, but it is enjoyable as is. well done."
aj9b0wn4hp,2354,nice outfits and expressions. the darkness of the close together sides of their faces makes it just a little less festive and inviting than ideal. but it also looks like the pose woudl make it difficult to correct for those shadows.
eulgdbfmgg,2355,love the lines and comp of this. beautiful black and white.
wjgqn6g7iu,2356,"i see you in a more positive light but in your sps, you seem to be brooding most of the time. hugs"
ij036anyg3,2357,thats some really neat construction. looks kinda spiderman like.
4wuu5qmfum,2358,too much motion blur and pixelation.
7yzfkg4pu0,2359,definitely see the cards equally but this is a little flatdull in tone
gcecpvz44a,2360,"comes across to me overly dark, im afraid."
q0oour0kua,2361,"very nice. kind of bright, which makes the highlights seem a bit overkill, but still good."
stnl07b5kp,2362,nice sequence of gulls. some good detail too. works well with equal s.
2674x6m2hu,2363,superb. congratz on the blue.
6xm3ab1mts,2364,to me this is quite dull and flat in your colors and tones.sorry
zxz4t64hup,2365,"im sorry, but on my screen this is incredibly oversaturated."
9junqq6bxd,2366,not crazy about the color. very interesting if icky subjects.
rfom3kgg2z,2367,nice subjects excellent black and white! i love it.
1n63y7sfrh,2368,"honestly i dont find veggies or flowers etc. against black very interesting, but it seems pretty popular."
vb927v998u,2369,nice detail and color of equal s
5w437rv106,2370,different the outlining works against this especially the blue against the green leaves.
5w437rv106,2371,odd treatment but otherwise an interesting piece. the balance is nice and colors are cool.
5w437rv106,2372,i love the bright poster look very interesting!
5w437rv106,2373,"sorry, i just dont like the overprocessed look. it stops looking ike a photograph and starts looking like something someone created in photoshop."
qnfklms51f,2374,"love the textures, color, light and comp."
qnfklms51f,2375,the flowers are pushed to the edge of looking fake and i like it. especially the veins in the pedals. very nice!
ytbz48c33w,2376,"nice choice of bw. but with the reflections it makes it six subjects so, dnmc. a"
mn8q02evsr,2377,"sorry, but i dont see equal things. nice mood to the image however."
70cmpsncqo,2378,interesting photo. i like the colors and textures. my only real complaint is that we can see the vases.
nkgzj24syp,2379,"ok, need little more light on baryte, and amazonite,"
e8ruohfcwd,2380,pretty girls are always nice but this one is such an odd pose and setup . humm .
9r4huw7sw9,2381,"nice visual, the colors are effective."
axpmuqu9sc,2382,"nice pic , nice color, but i can see more then three bandsmen"
nl3c7j0d25,2383,"would have liked this better without the reflections. theyre so pale, it doesnt really add much interest, imo. sorry!"
t4h3rdy4rt,2384,"i like this one, but the light is too much , dont like the shine on the flowers,"
lnhtjalhv6,2385,i like this. maybe a touch too much saturation in the trees but otherwise very nice.
4ov7w14qym,2386,one of my faves so far. id like to know what you used to get this look. other than having great light.
x1bm89p1t6,2387,just a little dark in the exposure.but and excellent capture
eqcoipitx8,2388,"well done. fine contrast, sharp throughout"
eqcoipitx8,2389,"wow, you sharpened all these, then actually dulled the ends a bit, that is dedication! the white one stands out nicely."
fcbkxuddgr,2390,nice sharp photo. not a great fit for the them tho.
am6yu4usmu,2391,this would be helped by a white balance adjustment. feels like the white ones should be whiter as is they dont look very appetizing
r1f56guma1,2392,"i get it, but imo its a little weak by definition.sorry."
tkrm3icrl2,2393,great capture! i love how each of the dragonflies are different colors!
ri0bs9glcj,2394,theres quite a bit of noise in the photo and i think i would have preferred it in color.
gmf9q7qmcq,2395,very nice colors in this image. i like the different shapes of the leaves.
m3dhj9yyji,2396,"nice warm feel to the image, but otherwise quite uninteresting."
yrkm63047b,2397,"a wonderful, warm portrait! love the quiet color."
3rpkca1oh9,2398,"wtg, chris. delighted for you that you got the posthunous blue."
iqeuydur7v,2399,love the sharpness and the fuzzy feeling of cold.
iqeuydur7v,2400,"wow, fantastic details and the colors are amazing."
q927f0ath6,2401,nice job on the bw julianne. great contrast.
5tcru132ou,2402,"yea, shake em. nice job on the bw mary. good contrast."
sw7kt11jhe,2403,"a little bit overexposed, nice nod to kermit."
sw7kt11jhe,2404,the yellows and oranges on this seem to be oversaturated on my monitor
sw7kt11jhe,2405,i like the colors of the peppers and the recurring shapes i just think it might be a tad overprocessed i seem some apparent sharpening artifacts
ukh7dxyzus,2406,"too easy. maybe if the picture had more punch more vivid colors or sharper, maybe."
tb7qsxx281,2407,i like the choice of color for your mm
pu98grxn8r,2408,"great work with the white on white, and the pun got you bonus points."
pu98grxn8r,2409,"its impressive how you can make such featureless objects look like theyre all facing the same way, closing in on the eggbeater."
du6ldyhovt,2410,good contrast and nice christmas colors!
27irtub4wi,2411,nice contrast of yellow against the blue.
lgssdfa8qr,2412,"a good idea, but i think the light is a little bit harsh, with all the flash hot spots, it distracts me a little"
lgssdfa8qr,2413,"nice, bright colors. one of the best of the mmskittles shots."
mymk4nswil,2414,"like the buildings and the sepia, if thats what it is. picture is nicely crowded, but not sure about the lone figure being in crowded situation."
u00xkvxlbh,2415,an intriguing approach but it suffers from real exposure problems i think.
u00xkvxlbh,2416,at first glance i didnt see the colours and thought you were just refering to the light.
elmjes89kt,2417,"terminally cute! lol! great idea, love the vivd colors!"
mdisf8v2cb,2418,cool idea. cool colors. the light reflections on the front pins are a bit harsh for me.
6zo3i5ra6s,2419,"good choice for black and white, gives it a classic feel"
hz59rus2rm,2420,most titans fans will feel her blueness about that game. good work.
8ebtt8wpkj,2421,"i think this would have been good in black and white too. some might say it could be sharper, but i dont think it would help convey the message in the photo any better."
7750gsapcj,2422,this would be so pretty if it werent totally overprocessed. too much saturation and usm.
3h5fkjf5lp,2423,lacks clarity and detail and could use some contrast.
8mtqwqln90,2424,good idea not sure the desat really works here but good idea all the same.
f43u0b32ho,2425,good idea. i saw another that looked much like this. other than motionless vs blurred motion she does not stand out from the others as much as the other photo and i dont see the hopelessness. she looks like she has a lot going for her.
f43u0b32ho,2426,"nice capture, she is a bit soft from her movement however."
f43u0b32ho,2427,"good use of motion blur, well done!"
f43u0b32ho,2428,the blueish tone really gives a hopelessness look to the picture. she really looks invisible to everyone around her. who hasnt had that feeling in highschool?
o62lht4ra7,2429,the only crticism that i have is the green tea itself. it looks too bluish green.
6vl5lk12rp,2430,"nice picture, veery weak relation to the topic"
rrswt28qhk,2431,nice interesting light and fab colours nice capture
h7bq2nzz7n,2432,"i happen to dissagree, but a beutful image nonetheless, epecially the detail in the henna."
zwa1cri9t6,2433,very .very nice soft and fragrant image
zwa1cri9t6,2434,nice capture nice light and pp best so far.
zwa1cri9t6,2435,"the first image ive really loved. well composed, good colour and nice processing. hope you do well!"
o0qxpiq4ug,2436,is that a pencile sharpener?
hle9p3ixga,2437,"youll hear that a lot colors are washed out. exposure is good, a little too soft"
5dke6h88ur,2438,nice way you have the image taken at night and the light shining through gives it a gastly image good job
978xu0pt55,2439,i do not understand what this is an image of. it is very unclear. nice try but next time make it sharper.
95v33x0dsm,2440,"perfect control of the light, great picture"
9gnw1yzxgz,2441,ahh. but special dark is
9gnw1yzxgz,2442,"cute, cute, cute. love the idea and the light is great."
jlrsdvkfrs,2443,"i like how clear this image is. the yellow against the white is interesting! when i look at this photograph, i get a refreshed feeling because it just looks so clean, love it!"
59wr4zm8ea,2444,very retro feel. sepia was a very good choice for this picture. .
bbmn0qz14h,2445,"its so cool, times model and both time a blue one, whuuppie"
bbmn0qz14h,2446,fun image. ouch! lol love that you chose black and white with a gritty look.
5zdcilt4k4,2447,this is a fun image. it was a good call to use those styrofoam containers. fairly fun image. a bit flat but fun.
7833javlij,2448,"good picture, bad quality"
uha0ajzd5d,2449,"a lovely photo, very zenlike, one of my favourites. i like all the green, its calming."
93pqw3i5m3,2450,awesome colors! great contrast and balance.
dehrk53scj,2451,great idea but let down slightly by the harsh light and slightly awkward pov.
tm0q0u1ijb,2452,this is a neat idea but the whole thing seems a little busy.
f8f1hqkeub,2453,"cute image, very nicely captured, however, i dont think i care so much for the blue colour. but very nice all the same."
4us7ezt3wu,2454,"looks green to me, not prime tho"
rcmeh90jr4,2455,"this is a fun image, however, i would have liked to see the bottles moved a bit closer to the edge. everything else seems to work fairly well."
ce3ik5dc34,2456,"looks like taken from a science fiction movie, maybe because of all this white."
4ev2eoudz6,2457,love the light in the hands in this one. really emphasises the hands.
4ev2eoudz6,2458,"this is a fantastic idea and the execution seems very well. however, i think there is a tad to much yellow light on the laying model."
4ev2eoudz6,2459,the blue lightingbackground makes this image really interesting. its also really awesome how you made the hands lit. nice job!
z02wikiguh,2460,uhh.whats the gooey white stuff?
tp72apat6g,2461,good idea but your flash is too bright.
vu2gzhbydy,2462,nicely executed. good balance of lights and darks.
vu2gzhbydy,2463,great idea well done for going the extra mile i like it a lot. great light best one for me so far
hs1prsouo3,2464,nice capture like the light but just loses a little too much detail in the shadows.
sci3u23suu,2465,"for me it is two gritty and the hard light doesnt help. not sure what i would have liked to see with this, but just doesnt hold me enough."
qdcjsy24zz,2466,interesting light and tones maybe just a little uninteresting.
7h37mrln5x,2467,"this is funny. i dont care for the light, would have been nice if it was really even accross the sides. very nice idea."
xl2xrkuszx,2468,"i think that the photo as a whole seems a little washed out, but the figure of the photographer against that color blue is really nice and melodic!"
0wx54gccod,2469,this is intersting! i love it! all the colors and the naturalness of it are great!
0wx54gccod,2470,photo a little blurry and soft
6lw5pb3uoy,2471,greart idea i like the colour scheme here and the detail. .
y6x92zg0yi,2472,nice and sharp seems to have some sort of colour cast?
y6x92zg0yi,2473,cool idea. it has a little yellow tinge to it.
aqce25j6yp,2474,looks too soft for this type of picture nice tones.
5m1qkv66wu,2475,reaching for miles davis kind of blue
m3u6k3cyve,2476,nice a verity of color would be nice
m3u6k3cyve,2477,love the repetition and the black and white. great idea.
5a1bzof7ty,2478,very pretty i might have preferred a gentle desat in this rather than the sombre sepia.
l9kyqz448k,2479,"pills pills and more pills. i dont care for pills. but this is a fairly clean shot.i think it needs a touch more contrast, but its a nice image."
nytby9qije,2480,pretty good contrast in black and white. looks a little too soft.
2yebgqniyj,2481,"we can all learn from your mastery of tones, colors and gradients."
2yebgqniyj,2482,"great work kieth,well deserving of the blue."
2yebgqniyj,2483,this image was my for this challnge. i love it. the subjects work well and the coloring adds that finishing touch. well done!
gpmdbn64ay,2484,great bw portrait. the selective desat really helps it pop like its really glowing. great
cbv3lvt8yv,2485,very slick. a little noise but still good.
u7f9t2ukjb,2486,think this needs a better surroundings to highlight the outofplaceness factor.
n5ytsx4jh2,2487,not sure where the anachronism is within this picture. the exposure is good though and really like the bw treatment.
v1b0rb8s1r,2488,lol.very fun and creative.i like the light and the pose.did you find a place to put the nozzle?
2wcpve54ed,2489,awesome idea and processing. the coloring works well on this to give it a yesteryear feeling.
2wcpve54ed,2490,"very cute period piece, lovely sepia feel to it."
o4fq4723bf,2491,great contrast in old and new technolorgy
xl6ix3utnf,2492,amazing the gift god gives some men. better yet amazing what some men do what the gift god gave them. a bit to much yellow for my taste.
rtbsfo2o47,2493,otherwise wonderful color contrast in the image.
3a62kkolib,2494,"really like this picture, very stark contrast between the buildings"
3a62kkolib,2495,"at first, i didnt get this anachronism. them i looked at it more and i now understand the contrast between the modern and old building. i hope others get this too."
3a62kkolib,2496,very nice work with the lines and color in this image.
xkhskujjky,2497,uh.really.um. the whites are a bit overexposed?
sr0ozdb2qp,2498,"i like it, lots of detail on offer"
mr0g0672rn,2499,"very photogenic petronas, but a tad bit overexposed."
6egbo3kur0,2500,very nice photo. good clear quality.
dllzcued3s,2501,somehow it is a bit blurry. also all the flares make the photo a bit too busy.
ti2tzx9m82,2502,a bit blurred. could use a little more contrastsaturation to bring out the neon colors.
d9szlb2u8f,2503,wish it was a little bigger. mood is good.nice light on lines.
q0logc1963,2504,ooh this is all a bit funky! lots of things to look at which i really appreciate. im glad its not in colour because that mightve just got too confusing. .
4lq2b01o5m,2505,because of the coloring you used on this photo you cant tell what time of day it is. there for who knows if there really working overtime.
fj7yf0f91g,2506,exciting. the use of sepia was perfect. i normally do not like borders but this one fits.
fj7yf0f91g,2507,"i like the silhouettes, imo they make the picture, and the black and white. good job."
16itbbjwvf,2508,"i like this. without knowing any details, possibly a slower iso speed, andor a neutral density filter may help to keep highlights from blowing, thus preserving the colour nformation if there was any too see more clearly the red, and green trails."
gwjshgkz0l,2509,"wonderful capture. clear, defined photo with nice colors."
8onqsb9vzw,2510,"i tried, but yours made mine stink, so i did another approach. great sharpness, colors, and clarity."
d1pnvvnucb,2511,i dont think you add anything to this photo by going greyscale. there really isnt a classic look or a vintage look to make this a better picture by going bw. it doesnt have much going on in the photo and i think that really hurts it.
uldsu7sf2u,2512,the yelloworange tinge distracts from an otherwise great photo.
uldsu7sf2u,2513,would a diffeent white balance setting make it less orange?
mhsrkn1ccj,2514,cool! nice use of subtle light on the clocks.
8oplxlf8fd,2515,i think using the white lines on the junction would make a better picture.
vk8qvu92p6,2516,"this is very nice, sexy. i like this. black and white sets the mood as well"
rpxl2p8a99,2517,"not that hard, just took out the red and blue colors, added saturation, a little contrast, boom, its there."
rpxl2p8a99,2518,too pixilated lacks clarity green cast doesnt compliment photo very much.
rpxl2p8a99,2519,"cant say i really like the effect with the green, its too much and too distorted to me. are you using real night vision equipment or is this a simulated demonstration?"
ul996o5pp2,2520,"i like the ambiance of this pic , the color makes a lot for it."
jeakhykyej,2521,poor use of color.too dark in spots
1jw2bp0h6u,2522,nice image. this has a journalistic quality and i wonder if bw might be interesting.
5zq5f2jfsf,2523,"ive just discovered that this pic shouldve been dqd since the foggy filter used isnt allowed. all i can say is, oops! i am now much clearer on the filter rules and wont let it happen again. my apologies"
len6yohbl8,2524,love the yellow glow and the shadows. seems he missed the party. everything is closed! o
w7b8sbbi0m,2525,"and i usually hate black and white, but this is nice!"
psgbx6inrb,2526,dpcers only seem to like sharp photos. dont have the equipment to take sharp nightshots though.
0s53t0el8e,2527,nice colors from the neon lights. if someone was actually getting a tatto it would have been a very powerful photo.
nno6yms6s4,2528,i add x pixels white and black borders arround the picture.
u185zpupd5,2529,"my first reaction to this photo, is wow, great color."
u185zpupd5,2530,great telephotography. lovely colors.

5d2z72e8dx,2533,beautiful photo! i love the crispness and superb clarity of this.and the lights and color are fantastic.good job!
0lcmlzdbfm,2534,"a bit grainy, but most night shots show this."
etnbdqckit,2535,"a little too much movement in this photo, but a nice idea ."
hr6dzsuhnm,2536,"i dont see this as night life, maybe night light. i mean, to me night life is something taht happens regularly, not on a occasion."
nem7j26hmi,2537,"the person really makes the image more interesting. i like the soft, grainy look for this situation."
vt9lqp1l93,2538,this is neat.has a classic look and feel to it.
o3fduzqrfi,2539,this was my pick for the blue hands down! i love everything about it the technical

rbcy9gq34z,2541,aww! good call on the bw and nice contrast as well.
pckju6ssow,2542,i think this would be a very sweet photo if the quality and colors were a little better.

gmz98bbl3n,2544,what a great picture.and i love the outtake! lol its classic! d
nthmnp8h3t,2545,the edit really makes the image. cool mood you got from it.
56eyeo2skv,2546,"nice image well captured, good exposure everywhere, nice choice on the bw"
t0wnmoctzn,2547,"this might have more impact if it were brighter and had stronger contrast, so that the white shades in the photo were really white instead of gray."
t0wnmoctzn,2548,"its a good photo, but i improve the contrast of black and white conversion"
1bmdkqydfd,2549,good intensity and clarity.
1bmdkqydfd,2550,lovely colourful picture. and they are good at that. wonderful motion
g4c4494co9,2551,slightly dark on my calibrated screen which means excellent potential may not be realised. love it though.

imb78e3ywe,2553,"great stopped motion, wonderful pose of both birds!"
imb78e3ywe,2554,"i thought i had seen yours already, but now im sure this is it. this is amazing! my choice for blue so far. and very inspiring."
b7lx8vgfxl,2555,"a very amusing photograph that falls short of being perfect. a little longer look would have helped along wtih a brighter exposure. still, a very interesting image with a good humor component. well done."
fwn0gnz5ty,2556,"ooh, purty. maybe a tiny bit overprocessed around the wings, but lovely."
cdltijalta,2557,ahh sweet. lovely motion picture
yzus2219ys,2558,"enticing, seductive, puzzling. equals full poetic motion."
yzus2219ys,2559,ooh. . .i love photography like this. these birds make such graceful and beautiful blur photos. nice job!
w5dz080vri,2560,"good, but finding the saturation a bit too intense for my personal preferences."
hme9f9iytq,2561,you have a real talent in your execution of motion blur mae.
hme9f9iytq,2562,like the swirls of movement and the character captured.
hme9f9iytq,2563,very nice use of blur! youve captured the grace and the power well. the blues compliment this very nicely!
dsvu7xvtq5,2564,great picture and they have a woulf like quality to them.
n5lg9m4yga,2565,"a little blurry, but i know these guys can be difficult to photograph. i have a few hundred meg of failed koi shots to prove it!"
ryhyt2txmi,2566,"the photo could be great, but the photo was taken at the wrong time of the day which created an overexposure to the photo."
ib7fxyf9oa,2567,that fellow must have run real fast. i like the warm tones.
3lefcs6p30,2568,tremendous picture appears to be more stationary than in motion but hey that doesnt change the fact its a great picture.
3h2pw4ln5i,2569,"i wish i could analyze this picture as well as some of the other commenters. fact is i love everything in this picture. the splashing, colour, movement and detail."
zej3gbfzsh,2570,"as i said before i suppose this is a calliope, if you can get a male he will be beautiful in color, but she is gorgeous!"
9h1nuvvp6y,2571,lovely picture with very little motion.
pyqtgsadkh,2572,"not exactly motion, but still a great capture."

2guojlr6gz,2577,"impressive find, but some photoshop would really help and better pov"
jh5lu02cn7,2578,great photo beautiful color contrast.
jh5lu02cn7,2579,wow how pretty. i feel mesmerized by the blue. what a clear picture and i love the angles. nice work.

jecpcznsjh,2584,they are sweet and you captured their eagerness and movement with great success

gfjo5m36sx,2586,"this is really nice, good decision to go with the bw."
loxodguwm0,2587,almost too dark in spots. interesting subjects though

qzuvf2aa50,2596,"great clarity, contrast and exposure."
0aev9yk418,2597,"well done on avoiding a photoshop frenzy and producing an excellent, well toned photo."
eh0v053zhi,2598,the little detailed things like the light hitting the edge of the flaking bark are what make it special for me.
eh0v053zhi,2599,wonderful tones. i guess its duotone.
7z9autm5sl,2600,this is an awesome bw photo. the exposure looks perfect!
atdqexc129,2601,super technical quality and clarity.
atdqexc129,2602,balck and white does this a lot of justice.
8mi0ab3ang,2603,"i would like to see the original one , it seems to be a beautiful place because bw darkens a little bit."
8mi0ab3ang,2604,"needs a little more detail in the shadows, but a striking image"
6j1ids3l1c,2605,a little more detail in the clouds and the bark would help as well. i think there are more tones in this that we can improve upon.
4bk3r05wt6,2606,a welcome change from the gloomy landscapes!
4bk3r05wt6,2607,excellent tonality. st ansel would be proud.
ymylew9mnw,2608,"technical , a little detail lost in shadows, though whites do hold their detail"
wzrowfs8pe,2609,"i love the detail of this, the different shades in the rocks help make this more interesting."
8npj0n5u4j,2610,the striking light and detail just superb. this was one of my picks.
ebe6wnjzx4,2611,wow thats cool. must have been in the evening. a little dark.
6y5pj2vqer,2612,"a little lacking in detail in the shadow, otherwise beautiful"
1y260zjxef,2613,"i like this, maybe a little bit more detail in the trees could have improved it."
1y260zjxef,2614,"yeah.very cool, i with there were more gray tones though.but a will do"
jvc9xwb3u8,2615,this has a very apocalyptic feel to it. very desolate and dark. im sure your processing helped alot in achieving this feeling. very nice.
jvc9xwb3u8,2616,"beautiful. amazing what nature can do. oh, and your photograph is very nice as well lol this seems just a little flat, but not bad."
fnx6umvudv,2617,i think i would like it a little more sharp but very cool picture otherwise. good job.
fnx6umvudv,2618,"great capure, feels alittle soft, though"
04wwfyiksm,2619,great job! this photo is a true ansel adams champion! well deserved blue !
347vxok4tk,2620,not enough black and white contrast.flat image
fw19m8ogpu,2621,"very good picture, but i think competition is for black white."
2knvcryok7,2622,a bit to dark imho.why not a slower shuttertime?
g2a4ee3m8q,2623,good contrast with the various tones
g2a4ee3m8q,2624,dark leaves are maybe a little too dark very tricky exposure though.

rvgj3j9clp,2627,nice tones and shadows.good contrast too.
nmj8zpnwwj,2628,doent look like ansel bw tone. there is a blue ton.
wt9uweyfbm,2629,a tad heavy on the sharpening
du6yva70nf,2630,"looks good, the white is a little hot though"
du6yva70nf,2631,should have used this in light on white igave you an eight anyway love it
du6yva70nf,2632,my feeling is that there is just on much white here for a aa type photo.
vwlvn6genl,2633,"not much nature, but neat nonetheless"
4oiz6swex4,2634,"good photo, but with the blue cast it does not have a feel of adams photo"
4oiz6swex4,2635,a bit blue but beautiful never the less
4oiz6swex4,2636,"too much blue, though the clarity of the image is grand."
4oiz6swex4,2637,beautiful image and great editing. like the bluish cast.

3s737mrt12,2642,sure glad we do not have all that white stuff
3s737mrt12,2643,wow! drama.i wonder.could it be possible to create this using a longer exposure? this way creating more motion in the clouds for more impact?
uw9j9cf2uf,2644,"i like the detail of the snowy branches, but i feel that the path behind intrudes too much."
s120r0lvql,2645,oh cool. i love rural buildings. this is a great one in black and white.
exw6ahf38e,2646,"good details in the dark while still going bright, success!"

o8t8wr645o,2650,"beautiful photo that, i think, could use a bit more contrast but other than that, great job i love it"
wo9z360nq3,2651,"technical , excellent dark skies to contrast with clouds."
cssvl3jwf3,2652,getting close to the real deal although the clouds look as though they have been burnt to hide overexposure
cssvl3jwf3,2653,"too much contrast, even for ansel"
cbzdn5cvn4,2654,you got the white and the black but the varied grays are not there.
60cqofufzo,2655,beautiful! a tad oversharpened. nice setting .

6g3lrhhgz2,2660,great clean lines and excellent contrast.
vceyyxh08c,2661,but it needs a little more contrast in either the trees or the scrub. i gave you an
59jwlh15br,2662,though possibly needs more highlight tone for aa
59jwlh15br,2663,"appeal , awesome lights and great tone balance for this tricky exposure"
5i686pp79i,2664,this may be intentional to make the image look old but i would have prefer a litle more sharpness. represents the texture well but i cant say i find the image very original or interestin.

ncykccr1hq,2667,nice waterfalls. i would prefer a bit more contrast in the image.

nd5qzwldnx,2669,beautiful capture of the light rays.
y4jxtwky4b,2670,this is nice. i like the imagination of colors this causes.
y4jxtwky4b,2671,"ahh. downward to darkness, on extended wings."
y4jxtwky4b,2672,"i know little of divinity, but those are my own expectations downward to darkness."
nmkf5ks1sq,2673,"surreal, almost creepy. great choice for a non color. guessing would not have this effect at all if it was color."
rq68nncjgs,2674,"very nice becky, nice detail. makes a wonderful bw"
rq68nncjgs,2675,this is a nice capture of this familiar landmark. its the first ive seen in bw.
tgbrjorhkq,2676,sorry but there is way too much overblown highlight for this to work imo.
8ve228cw9w,2677,now thats nice! maybe my monitor is a bit bright but i would like to see some darker tones here.
8ve228cw9w,2678,i love the light and that wispy cloud. beautiful!

3aaulhj3wv,2681,rich tones fading off into that soft background.beautiful
r0ohvb9tbr,2682,very impressive. it definately has the ansel adams look

6nlstake07,2687,great clouds and bw conversion.
vlmrxzx91p,2688,more contrast and some more sharpening could give your image more pop.
t9a04fyoff,2689,"yes, this is a dandy. conrats on the red, well deserved."
y6565ds06s,2690,everything is very muted and gray. would like to see some true whites.

z95xuuqi71,2692,"real ansel feel here. expansive, dramatic, huge detail. nicely done."
r83ggzgzmc,2693,"as much as this version says ansel to me, i think i actually like the color version better."
r83ggzgzmc,2694,"another blue for joe, excellent. i had a hunch this was you!"
vheundkcwk,2695,"loose the contrail next time, it adds nothing but distraction."
2lhyuy1hbl,2696,this image looks highly psd but its pretty cool. the black to white levels is sweet.
2lhyuy1hbl,2697,awesome! my pick for the blue
d9q61a9pi2,2698,sections of this photo are very dark. taking multiple shots at different exposures and merging them together would help that.
bf1kssdnih,2699,"often i dont like this technique, but the desaturation works well here. good play on the black and white in color idea."
eu083tqzdk,2700,"imo there is too much to see here and the contrast is too great, even assuming you are outlining the pigeons."

bz1iegdofz,2710,"well, at least we dont have to ask sc about the official brown because we dole them out ourselves. freedoms just another word."
o35se1xl4i,2711,"wow you are using that new macro so very well. great detail and textures but i also,love the softness."

s3ungc733k,2726,her fingernails are a weird color.
s3ungc733k,2727,"nicely done. pretty, soft and appealing. the fingernails are a bit out of place i think."

2q2btne3rr,2765,"nice photo, has a little too much noise for me, and a little out of focus.but for difficulty i say ."

5zy3kvcaaj,2784,"a brilliant idea, but the color seems a bit off. looks overly yellow?"
jcru1y133d,2785,"i like the idea, lots of lines but they led off the picture and the bottom is too bright."
sc88j1vhif,2786,super idea. the blue swirls add great ambience.
rppn74yqn0,2787,the color here is great. the highlight may be too brave for some. bump.

9w8g25akmz,2811,very strange. colors are flat some contrast adjustments would have helped.
7y93r2svqu,2812,"nice idea, but it would have looked a lot better if it had been a bit sharper."
rt6icl4xa5,2813,"is this the liaque encounter. nice idea, but the light is to much."
r3l86djulq,2814,this is a nice image. i really like the shadow and thought that are seen in this photograph.
jtndx6xgv4,2815,to much blur. nice idee.
ht5x29ljwa,2816,i like this one a lot. it probably would have looked just as good or better without the white stuff in my opinion.
rqgy9f0nk5,2817,"i love the lightning, and the personality you gave to this picture. good job!"
16km13g1f0,2818,nice macro with the rich color

i69daiau53,2824,lovely dark tones and amazing drops ! how did you do those drops ? very nice .
6pr99e29kp,2825,except for a little too much color and a bit of blurring neat picture.

aqt0zseipt,2827,nice image good color and detail
a0v2u49xda,2828,the bright white is a little destracting

734i5h20j9,2834,"hey, you stole my idea at least you did a better job than me. looks good, i like the red glow, it doesnt work as well with green ones. what did you use as light source? i see no wires. ."
734i5h20j9,2835,those are really pretty. cant wait to see how you made them light. beautiful.
cv1tpqz57s,2836,"sorry, the idea is cliched, and previous executions presented better quality images."
xaybw1on4c,2837,way too much noise and compression shades.
roa6u95e8o,2838,hmm. suspicious. but maybe in movement that can be possible.
roa6u95e8o,2839,too artificial for me. gravity? what do the books add?
2vcf1j9p0e,2840,i really like this photo. it almost has an eerie facial quality to it.
2vcf1j9p0e,2841,"oohh.ahh! what can i say, but this image is hauntingly beautiful. the colors, shadows, lights and shapes are striking. now i understand the meaning of make this photo your own. nice job on a unique image."

c2i02fkmdz,2854,"wow, awesome action and colors!"
vchbq58z0g,2855,great idea marred by poor technical control. even a contrast adjustment would have made a big difference here.
vchbq58z0g,2856,i like the idea a lot but im not too sure about the coloring of the pic.
t3au4lz3ks,2857,not sharp a bit boring im afraid
sl62wwojeu,2858,"good looking photo, great idea, great color"

csa17kacjg,2863,"i wish i was an apple,mm. not to be eaten .in the front a little to dark."
cseo4531kh,2864,i like this pcture but it doesnt say much. i like the desaturation etc good job
cseo4531kh,2865,"what nice clear, sharp focus.gj"
bdm1u5g44e,2866,bad saturation ! sorry ! not blue!
bdm1u5g44e,2867,cool idea. somewhat grainy or dusty.
d2nd50hgh3,2868,more eaten than rotten by the looks of it.the image is a little too dark imo

mux3b57smr,2870,second pass. bumping because its just so sharp.

zagr6uzp9x,2874,this is a nice iamge. i really like the shadow and darkness seen in thsi iamge.
vgvhi233iv,2875,literalism combined with anatomic and biblical allusions. love the shadow of the stem.
1hxgstennf,2876,"nice splash, everything is clear and sharp. well done"
h2fa08f7vw,2877,the color simply doesnt work for me at all. for some reason it makes me think she is diseased. with a different color treatment this could have been an average image.
ssf1diethm,2878,"nice idea, although a little dark and blurry."
2lyqci97ye,2879,i think this would have been cool in a black and white tim burtonesqe kind of way.
2lyqci97ye,2880,i found the white black a little jarring. i would have preferred all white or all black. i think.
9ise8ugk5g,2881,thought provoking nice exposure work with woderful clarity.
2j1s1zjr76,2882,"soft and dark, this is another one that reminds me of those classic still life paintings."
2j1s1zjr76,2883,"i liked it very muchi think it would do better with a tad more lightnot too much, though, i do like the darkness"
ij2mr9i7o5,2884,it just feels so real. very nice im sorry to see it placed so far down the line.
x3uwcotjlb,2885,great detailing and extra points for creativity ill always look closer before i take that first bite!
spxabux2qe,2886,seems a bit oversomethingorother. not sure what it is but it seems almost blown out on detail in a few places.
dnsh6ljx6d,2887,very nice contrast working. at first i thought it was a swat team! hahaha.
ii977ec4ay,2888,a bit oversharpened but super juicy!
ii977ec4ay,2889,good contrast bit over sharpend in front
ycy6j91ia5,2890,good idea but poor light and wb
9uxqri6six,2891,it looks like your white balance is really off kilter on this.
5ytat57dbq,2892,"if you upped the contrast a bit more, it would have hid the seam a little better. nice idea though!"
wvhdyty4lk,2893,this could be a nice stock photo for a dieting site. i feel like you could use a bit more light.
i2bsvlilyq,2894,"creepy, i like the feel and ambience."
gacvkud3ui,2895,nice capture. very dynamic. great color and light.
gacvkud3ui,2896,"wow, this is very beautiful. great color and stopped action. clarity is perfect"
w3wgx68tyd,2897,"great texture. shame about that highlight bit, could you have masked it anyhow to retain detail?"
u72zdmdd5e,2898,"with a flash? seems to work, the hard shadows clever good detail"
u72zdmdd5e,2899,"tone down that flash! a longer lowlight exposure should work, the cards arent moving!"
wf596ct6ix,2900,really great use of bw. good play of shadows as well.
nbtwpwbpyv,2901,"just a touch too blownout, if it were just the windows itd look better, but too much of the walls detail is lost."
zo74hjt96t,2902,"great setting, nice contrast."
4mqw31ywse,2903,i like the relative monochrome of the bldgs with the red brake lights.
4mqw31ywse,2904,i cant pick one.theyre all competing the all white skys unfortunate its grainy
gmk98o8ff3,2905,i definately like this. the colorization is perfect for setting the mood of the photo.
gmk98o8ff3,2906,i always think sepia is a great tone for these settings.
gmk98o8ff3,2907,sepia? reminds me of the sticker club machines all over japan.
lcjj50zm3e,2908,oh yes. tilts and more tilts. today is my first day to this site and im amazed at what i have seen so far. your color here is beautiful.
lcjj50zm3e,2909,"nice and clean, good colors, nice angles."

5szl9nj4ez,2918,nice twist . and in bw
0brwr4aved,2919,this picture might have been better at a different time of day the white is a little overwhelming.
12tlrdvbl2,2920,i like the use of natural light. this is a very attractive picture.
qtd6atuerv,2921,"tones a little flat i see the shapes more than the light. good one, though."
qtd6atuerv,2922,unfortunately you didnt see the correct contrast. no real blacks and definitely no whites. my photo teacher in college would of killed me for this one.
qtd6atuerv,2923,could have been a little clearer and some more contrast would have been nice
qtd6atuerv,2924,kind of boaring and you cant really see whats going on down by the light
qtd6atuerv,2925,not enough contrast. no true blacks and whites. just varying greys. not a bad idea.
l24x35vwx6,2926,would have been a better picture if you captured the bottom of the device.nice exposure
vnz7z5muzu,2927,"the trees seem like theyve been sharpened too much. as well, the colors are very dull. almost too dull."
vs88n3o6z9,2928,never have i seen this type of image done with such luminance.
y7lucc3a5a,2929,the light is magnificent. minutes earlier or later would have lost this magic. great photo.
5jfjlj7p3w,2930,beautiful building. colours seem a bit flat. a boost in saturation levels would really give this photo punch
8bftwzn7h7,2931,i loved the choice of desat. with this. beautiful!
8bftwzn7h7,2932,neat effect . the makes the already interesting picture even more interesting
8bftwzn7h7,2933,much better than the average desat image. you are to be commended. i usually dont like those type of images all that well. great job.
rrd2g4xx7l,2934,henry what a magnifent bw. what a pleasure to observe. superlative study.
rrd2g4xx7l,2935,"something about this one i really like, but i think it would be improved with a little less forgroundsidewalk, and it looks a little overprocessed."
rrd2g4xx7l,2936,"nice, could be nicer in color, it has enough elements to get a color photo. good work."
g8wbywg011,2937,"would be a very good photo, but too much noise and yellowish colors are not very pleasant"
jvaaf1ee09,2938,"i like this, but it just feels in need of a little more contrast."
6se6p6u7ce,2939,nice duotone and use of shadows.
s3rgczyaj0,2940,just a little dark and snapshotty
anjx5rx0fl,2941,very nice contrast good choise with the doutonesepia.
ayr9bsonxt,2942,nice simetry and forms but the colors look rather strange to me.

9ox0e2pkhh,2945,congrtulations with the blue rippon
xsigzk62it,2946,fantastic repetition and light.
tn0eual2td,2947,i think i wish this wernt so dark. i am sure it was your intent but it doesnt work for me.
c9bxvgbp1g,2948,nice comp and choice of color.
c9bxvgbp1g,2949,impressive dramatic capture. looks good in sepia.
hfr34fy1ve,2950,"reflections of one building in the other, very nice. nice colors too"
hfr34fy1ve,2951,nice use of reflections and colors.
70eq4t78kf,2952,looks like a neat subdivision entrance.
xhnktezszr,2953,"ahh, this is a good picture, i like the colors they really give the picture life"
k6yhwgjxtj,2954,"i was really diggin the funky colors! damn. well, i gave you a , cuz i really like it."
k6yhwgjxtj,2955,"while the mood is quite good, the image is kind of ragged and appears oversaturated. a ."
6u242kitca,2956,i think a bw version of this would have been stronger due to the textures. but thats just me.
zsu9jsna3d,2957,"good control of exposure, nice and sharp."
zsu9jsna3d,2958,good useage of black and white
5sd6gfbwmw,2959,needs more ambient light or more photoshoping.
x59gt1if8n,2960,nice warm glow. think it might have been more dramatic if it was clearer.
4r05hy4b34,2961,"cool great curves, good timing of day to use the light."
4r05hy4b34,2962,love these buildings. the wonderful curves give this a feeling of motion. the architect who designed this did a terrific job.

5di7crj7eo,2964,"another personal best! wtg! this is a nice, clean image. the spiralling lines work really well, and i like the contrast. nice detail. i dont have any suggestions for improvement. nice job!"
5di7crj7eo,2965,thats beautiful. i really like the bw effect.
bm714zkpmn,2966,this has a great heaviness about it.the light is engrossing.intersting work.
bm714zkpmn,2967,fantastically eerie light looks like a movie set for a thriller but better. marvelous offkilter angles.
yebkclnvwf,2968,beautiful light and wonderful gothic feel . i like this a lot.
yebkclnvwf,2969,great use of dark to enhance the looming mood. wonderful work.
yebkclnvwf,2970,popping image nice shadows good color nice lines
pfuemo0een,2971,"i like the subtle color gradients, but not the oversharpened look"
5kivvxqpog,2972,"i love the soft glow, the image feels so warm."
5kivvxqpog,2973,"lovely, soft and subtle image of this gothic building.i like it."
wl2v3qaqpk,2974,"interesting photo, hard to tell exactly what it is or even which way im looking though! the whites could be whiter though, its an image crying out for some photoshop love."

85x0t7nfxs,2983,this is very cool. great dramatic lines and colors.
9w479ok47k,2984,"gotham, great idea! i love the soft glow."
9w479ok47k,2985,nice use of the contrast and the black and white.
9w479ok47k,2986,the soft treatment gives the image an almost surreal look. very nicely done.
bqc8o2uabq,2987,the picture looks a bit washed out! might have been a good idea to play with levels and curves to give it a better contrast.
iv5qwl3d1f,2988,i like the contrast of old vs. new here.
vgc1sdx0mt,2989,luscious and beautiful remniscient of heavenly clouds and bosoms its great i think the pink and green reflections are particularly nice.
9sxf4a99dx,2990,interesting forms but the light is not as interesting.
u809t8huui,2991,youve taken an ordinary building and made something special with the color adjustments.
1ety1kc6nd,2992,i like it. did you use ni? the dreamy quality is sorta neat.
1ety1kc6nd,2993,looks like a picture from an adventure with these color contrasts o nice one.
fmclmlwwad,2994,really flat and unblanced white. adjust the white balance and maybe a little saturation and constrast.
fmclmlwwad,2995,"nothing tells me what it is if i didnt already know. also, it appears to have a color cast."
o43otpi1w2,2996,interesting contrast but i think it could have been better composed. also the light is very hard and the image is a bit blurred for my taste.

4q9xso96fa,3007,"the colors are beautiful, but oversaturated for my taste. the building is impressive enough without the extra help."

gf4w6o2mvq,3023,"love the darkness mystery no light here keep it intriguing, thought provoking."
jz6y2kz3l3,3024,"very nice color and tones. looks like nature trumps the building, though. which is saying something, because this is a terrific building."
binvemciqs,3025,this photo would be perfect if not for the yellow color cast. otherwise good job.
rvyizqd6i6,3026,i just gotta get me ir. never seen it with the yellow tint though. neat though. i cant decide if the boats help or hinder. too much of an apparent anachronism i think.
uu1aibp7wi,3027,"very unusual, red hot bricks."
v66827cbpk,3028,"image is very digitized. usually black and white will hide that, but this one seems to really be very rough. dont know if you planned it that way."
2m3wufyawf,3029,um.amazing color and lighting!love it
2m3wufyawf,3030,agreed. and it looks like a shadowhighlights job. good colors.
2m3wufyawf,3031,"nice one, nick. better than the aussie blue imo."
2m3wufyawf,3032,wow i really like the colours in this. the reflections off the columns are neat too.
g16coun56n,3033,"color is also good. nice blues, yellows and reds, without going overboard and oversaturating."
61990mpfmy,3034,"was this image supposed to be turned degrees? if so it really doesnt work for me. if it was a mistake, then i have an issue with the shadows as they appear on the building. either the building should be all in shadow or all in light."
elsntdz2yl,3035,"sorry, but on my monitor this is simply too dark."
sn9vduwrat,3036,"needs some punch. maybe more contrast, increased sat and grad tint."
so1shbzp2h,3037,"looks like this was a grand old building, good light here."
rhl4v3kjco,3038,i love the look of old churches! this one is so beautiful. i really like how everything is dark except for the alter! good job!
m0ohb53zzd,3039,neat elevators but i think there are too many lines and shapes going on for me.
xgu6v26xi2,3040,"what a huge building, what a place to live. photo seems very fuzzy though."
j2sj97ll3d,3041,love the leading lines and color to this one. great job.

p3drzphvke,3044,great angle.lovely black and white conversion
9x7lhrpmc8,3045,"nice bw conversion, good clear photo"
9x7lhrpmc8,3046,dramatic bw tones! great sharpness.
k4dkk11bgx,3047,i think something went wrong with your processing. the blue cast is unnatural and there is a lot of noise in the photo.
k4dkk11bgx,3048,you found the saturation slider! just too much.
yppekthbwh,3049,great building shame so much of it is in shadow needs better light
sgq4gzoe46,3050,sort of eerie looking with the light and shadows at night.
ajnc0i5zy8,3051,"terrific architectural detail. i should be bothered by the dirty windows, but im not. looks like you did some heavy denoising or something that gives it a slightly dreamysmooth quality, but i like it."
zsh8k8hqyk,3052,nice perpsective. good exposure and detail
shcm3vd4x9,3053,wonderfully soft tones with the sharp blue i love the tension these two make together
shcm3vd4x9,3054,unusual. i like the repetition of triangles in this image the different hues of white throughout.
cyyrd9phdf,3055,interesting.almost too busy but nice colors.
pnxl9y1c5p,3056,"i dont see much of interest in this photo, the light flash? is a bit harsh too. there seems to be good detail there is you could capture it in a different way."
bjh8p7t72o,3057,"sweet, i love the bright colors here! nice angles too. bb"
f4p8f8stgs,3058,a massive set of stairs! id love to see more detail in the actual stairs and railingscolumns

wpx5gl8pwv,3066,"good contrast in styles, but needs a tad more contrast."
b8erc8gy7v,3067,lovely path. nice use of late day light to get longer shadows.
rt0cgqa2q3,3068,i find too many elements in the picture are dark.
n6dr9ok2j5,3069,very nice mood. ive always wanted to get closer to these big cranes but havent figured out how to yet. good job.
5yzmau8gg6,3070,cool texture and colors. done very well technically. good work!
m71qcdpi3p,3071,v nice image but needs one appropriately dressed or motion blurred person for me.
mmdvgseqoz,3072,yes! i know this place well. very nice capture of it. great light!
zdi84hwhcc,3073,excellent light and tones. this really conveys cold!
7yrttpw98h,3074,"surreal colors, somehow reminds me of movies dealing with after the nuclear disaster scenarios"
kyyf5id4vu,3075,"awesome! a definite eleven. but youll have to settle for a , i guess. the color, detail and light quality is just wonderful!"
wuaw0pitkc,3076,"nice buildings, well lit, good exposure."
yea10vc77q,3077,"an eerie photo, disappearing into darkness. the colours seem odd but if you are going for creepy and eerie they fit well."
yea10vc77q,3078,longer exposure withouth the flash might have given more interesting natural light
bfc8j4p47k,3079,light a bit harsh for me and too omnidirectional
phm9lkmhaq,3080,wb should be whiter for me and i want to see the bottom inch of the photo you missed the bottom of the building out!
bc9lko9qdt,3081,nice lines and shapes and colors!
0wjp0ihj1g,3082,"great picture, i think it wouldve looked better in color instead of sepia."
0wjp0ihj1g,3083,love the colour tones and silvery look.
mgloea9a45,3084,"haha nobody would have guessed this was yours, although imo the colors and the processing are quite larusesque"
pfmepqwyzs,3085,"very nice, good contrast and marvelous shapes"
pfmepqwyzs,3086,"perfect simetry, good light and detail."
pfmepqwyzs,3087,almost feels like your falling into the image. i dont know if i like the duo tone tho. i know you cant do this in basic but a vignette on this would work well in my opinion.
1w7qvhu4l9,3088,"very interesting picture, and good black and white conversion."
044t8x6ec2,3089,"very nice a bit too dark, though, in the shadows."

agq13jaljp,3093,"dont like the building or the flat light, i am afraid"
nmlo9559sq,3094,cool building. needs some absolute white though. everything is grey!
5tm8cpgk0i,3095,"i love silhouettes, and this one with the glazing reflecting the light. amazing."
gka01phbqp,3096,"i gave this a thought it was an amazing locale, and the texture and colors are wonderful."
gka01phbqp,3097,"lovely warm glowy feel to this one, very nicely processed too"
lg18pss1jf,3098,nice. the sepia and grain noise? are really effective.
st38rsq7yb,3099,i like the idea but cutting off the bottoms on the buildings isnt working here. you also need to pop the colors more by increasing contrast or saturation so it isnt so flat.
sdvcfm6934,3100,"nice use of colors, shapes and lines."
jyz7roha63,3101,"philly, no doubt. nice contrast in styles."
rgj2smrlxt,3102,"love the colours of the blues through green through orange, really interesting and the shapes are too."

fs56iqegc4,3109,"luminous, beautiful tones, color, textures and formwell done!"
m1n3zd5qxz,3110,"great use of lines, reflections and color. raj"
cuxp732fyg,3111,"oh with some detail this could have been amazing, such a shame its so dark still worthy of a i think"

u7p9g99l3i,3113,"colors are brilliant, lines are crazy. love it."
25ausr9ypt,3114,"beautiful place, love the black and white conversion subtle light and even inclusion of trees."
j3zdaps0ku,3115,beautiful detail and good choice of soft sepia tones
lqv1xfnke8,3116,lovely image wonderful bw and the shadow play is really interesting
s33xtb3gui,3117,not sure about the hue change from blue to purple. doesnt hurt the image but it makes it kinda weird i think.
fvh6yi72gm,3118,image seems slightly flat and washed out. some levels andor curves adjustments would fix that.
ybe14fa135,3119,very cool color processing and the blur works well.
y8ao1rcqb1,3120,"oo frtiz lang eat your heart out, nice work and good choice of bw"
4lpos8jk6r,3121,nice. i wonder if you could have gotten closer and just shown off one of the structures. theres lots of great detail and texture there that i think were missing.
mwrqsyq49k,3122,very nice job on the bw processing.
5qnskar7ay,3123,great use of leading lines. amazing clouds. wonderful exposure. hope this does well.
5qnskar7ay,3124,clearly best in show for me. the leading line is wonderful.
64kg0bbnt0,3125,"not too heavily saturated which is good, i put the image in ps and found a shadow highlights help make the image pop just a tad more, but other than that no real issues i can see."
64kg0bbnt0,3126,"great color, crazy building"
vfsrt48p8m,3127,the person in the photo is kind of a blurry distraction.
4wea8whbhe,3128,great detail on the brissolleile!
isoh4r5ibc,3129,bce place in toronto? i think thats what its called. neat photo.
isoh4r5ibc,3130,great orientation.looks like something out of men in black
j45oz7cply,3131,"this is an awesome find, but something seems a little off in the processing it seems a little flat. im not sure if it just needs more contrast, or a bit more crispness. for the interesting capture, but i think it could be an or with some playing."
zljtx41gzj,3132,"i like the limited color pallette, looks a little bit off of straight"
banb5hlalp,3133,this building really does change dramatically depending on the light at the time and can be amazingly colorful.
banb5hlalp,3134,so how did you get these colors? your exif doesnt give the time of day you took this.
banb5hlalp,3135,beautiful warm colors and a really interesting metallic look.
b3mzz3tfaa,3136,"how the hell did you find this empty? we just flew out of there on the way to the caribbean, and it was a mess, lol."

3obc1nhw9e,3143,looks good in black and white. what a cutie!
3obc1nhw9e,3144,terrific light. beautiful photo.
x11xjl6p13,3145,i think it would have been helpful to have a slightly longer exposure to better illuminate and soften the subjects facial features. the light is a bit harsh as is.
4gurhhdhqh,3146,"the idea and capture is just fine, but it needs a highter contrast"
ottdv9jahi,3147,beautiful photo light source?
e8cec1clzi,3148,"in this case the blown highlight work for the image. not sure all will appreciate how you did it, however."
sxxpci8dxz,3149,"the photo is very dark, and its hard to make out the subjects when they are so very tiny."

e31a1kxg9r,3160,a bit more work in levels and saturation to bring out the green.just a little bit.needs more pop
k9f8fqy17a,3161,"some strange blue pixels here and there, the result of an incomplete selection ?"
ht1c4vq18w,3162,"lovely tones, shapes, and textures. a tad flat though."
0cxzozpdag,3163,the tones are very rich and reminiscent of asia. the soft reds and deep yellows are beautiful
0cxzozpdag,3164,"most image editors have the ability to adjust compression somewhere in the file save dialog. here is how it works in paintshop pro, along with more explanation of compression, if is is of any help"
unsdpn1c6k,3165,i like the balls in this with the blue background.very nice

zl5ko3x0lr,3174,im no expert on this but i think a controlled sharpening of this image would have moved you much close to a .

xw6a4bjc5m,3176,"i really like the subdued colors, they give such a feeling of early morning, going early to work to get a job done"
xw6a4bjc5m,3177,i like the fog.could the levels have made the colors a little less dull?

4qnuvzqff1,3187,umm. not sure i like the blurriness. fabulous idea though
t043nrd182,3188,i love the multitude of lines and shapes that all follow the one line in the picture. the texture works great too with the sepia.

y3hx25bw81,3190,cute. just a little blurry imo

zki1itgb2f,3198,color saturation and hue na image is monochrome
r4ziqv1fkz,3199,"the image appears too dark over all. i think more contrast could have been achieved in the bw conversion. or it could have been brightened a bit with a levels adjustment. the day is obviously sunny, judging by the shadows."
hqy38ychf6,3200,quirky. the choice for softness intrigues me.

36hlxmyvng,3223,"vivid use of line and color, great job"
l37acnw3ad,3224,good use of selective desat. i might have used just a tad less saturation on the line.
l37acnw3ad,3225,"ok, just not original. i like the yellow line a lot though."
as6i3hhkhy,3226,"color saturation and hue colors are well done, and realistic."

9srtzcpbav,3232,nice use of colors and reflections. calming feel to your photograph. nice processing. bump
yqddyes1kw,3233,nice jagged leading line. i wish it were more rich in tone though. id adjust levels or curves.

yn7i32z805,3235,"great job on making the yellow pop out, maybe just bump the contrast a bit to make the colours a lottle more definate, good sho nonetheless!"
ulheatn9z3,3236,"great detail, nice gray values in branches"
91x4ebw09o,3237,wow. i bet compression to k was tough on this one!

qght76ztob,3255,cool use of light and shadow! very well done but a bit soft.
tn15uq0rtq,3256,i like the detail in the leaves. you can spend a fair amount of time wandering around looking at the detail in each one.
tn15uq0rtq,3257,i like that the brown tips of the leaves really stand out here. the pp is nice as well.

knrdblo32l,3267,why why why i ask motion blur does nothing to help this image

hl859ljvi4,3277,great statement with this. nice texture as well.
v256qsj2xo,3278,"nice pic. i suspect its a tiny bit oversharpened, but i think that is probably due to using the wrong sharpening settings for x. pics are a lot more sensitive to sharpening at this resolution."
vjnu7w06we,3279,love the selective desat and the intricate detail of the roots is excellent. great capture!
vjnu7w06we,3280,this is lovely. i really appreciate the sentiment and the use of desaturation.
vjnu7w06we,3281,very nice how you were able to carry the selective desat down through the roots. well done photo!
cxriaun81w,3282,this is a little too red for me.strikes as very ps
wsxvb999l7,3283,there is also haloing evident due to the agressive denoising.
wsxvb999l7,3284,"wow !love the smoothness in there. well. excellent work, the darkness of his picture is quite appropriate, makes it scariest. grats!"
wsxvb999l7,3285,"excellent realization, beautiful colors, i love the mysterious feeling in it."
wsxvb999l7,3286,imho a perfect picture the colors are stunning. the pp is great.
wsxvb999l7,3287,".second look added to my favs. o personally i think the pp suits perfectly here, maby because it is rather oobvious and i think it goes with the mood of the picture. love it."
wsxvb999l7,3288,i like it but way too much neat image.looks like an illustration
7dj1c5888s,3289,"i really like thisserene feeling, beautiful color."
v99ysgdebr,3290,"fabulous tones, textures and colors."
p6n0as4axy,3291,nice capture this.beautiful soft light. well done
vy6r66j36v,3292,color is good. saturation and hue are well done.
4jtskbj5ei,3293,i like this a lot more if the foregroudn wasnt so fuzzy
4jtskbj5ei,3294,"not too bad, got a little too much green and this makes the picture a little confusing."
f3g92khh52,3295,too much green saturation. doesnt look real.
sdw2zuca4u,3296,i like the soft magical feel to this one.
i3kire6xan,3297,"image is a bit grainy for me, and a little dark for my liking"
vkl31dmavl,3298,photo is rather dark levels need adjustment
7w4i08ekcn,3299,whoa! thats some pretty hard contrast you got going on there i like the comp though.
5krx3u1vh3,3300,great colours and comp but all looks a bit blurry to me.
88bi915di8,3301,nice edge treatment it really adds to the drama of the photo.
rwhxahopgy,3302,great idea. i like the varieated layers of color.
dzxmztemqi,3303,excellent lines leading through the photograph. the colors are well done and rich yet naturally warm.
dzxmztemqi,3304,exquisite exposure. nice work indeed.
j5jirmc6l7,3305,ha! its like wheres waldo! lol. beautiful texture throughout the photo
q6gdjcu694,3306,"really nice compoosition and sepia tones works well. could be a tad more sharpened, imo"
sbbrzu1hdm,3307,i like the intense detail and the way you processed this. nice colours and rustic feeling.
jw2hq27kno,3308,"a bit dark in places on my supposedlycalibrated monitor, but i like the blue."
eo7mq3c8c9,3309,beautiful colours your processing worked very well. nice detail too.
eo7mq3c8c9,3310,beautiful!thats a brilliant shot!amazin colors n composition!though i would like it a lil sharper.u have my !good job!
lwryzv3dw3,3311,well framed. great colors. great mood. a certain .
ecgj9uqqle,3312,what an odd dynamic of nature. i pondered the forces of nature on this fine photo!
33jd3u47i7,3313,lovely softness and great monotone image. .
cs6d3ffpnw,3314,lol i kept looking at the white handles thinking something was odd. but now i see what they are hehe. i love the black and white tone.
t645luktv4,3315,"this has great colors, but seems a little bit too sharp for my tastes."
ium6g1qwsz,3316,"looks almost like out of africa, nice capture and colors"
q5v4yled1w,3317,nice job jeb. the colors are great.
057smkwwvv,3318,well done lydia. unique take on the topic. i hope it does well.
rm7wo7onaj,3319,"lovely mood, but the vignette is too harsh for my liking."
4qeayun2n2,3320,waww. nice iyad. i saw it for the first time.nice colors
4qeayun2n2,3321,"what an amazing image! the yellow blue are gorgeous together. i hope youll reveal where this was taken, im curious!"
y5ti8v9j9r,3322,big congrats to you debwhat a wonderful image. great mood to it!
y5ti8v9j9r,3323,"gorgeous and nice work with the hdr, you must be pretty steady to get that exposure merge handheld!"
jk70uxgxn6,3324,"seems a little dull and flat in the tone, might need more brightnesscontrast?"
m0atauha1p,3325,gives the image a bit of an ir feel being in black and white
m0atauha1p,3326,think the bw colors are to boring. would have been nice with some more dynamic in the colors.
j23e7cz8yo,3327,"very nice colors, great capture of the sun.beautiful"
z7nwr8stvt,3328,"seems a little soft, but its an interesting semisilhouette."
z7nwr8stvt,3329,a little bit too dark and too yellow for my tastes. gives the image an ominous feel.
j6gdrvxskw,3330,"im a relative beginner with photoshop. so i applied adjustment layers selective color and huesaturation. in fact not much remedy was necessary, as the leaves started out quite red."
j6gdrvxskw,3331,ok.really curious how you got the red leaves.wonderful.
o25utqv52o,3332,"fantastic photo, i love the dramatic processing and wonderful light. a well deserved blue."
o25utqv52o,3333,very interesting capture of light and variety of the rocks compared too the rolling hills.
013v15p8n9,3334,this was my pick for the blue. hands down the best of the lot. so gorgeous. you should make a print available. id love a big one!
eh7qwbymo5,3335,"added i am now looking at it on my calibrated monitor at work, and the dark edges of the vignette are even more evident now. if it is not visible on your monitor, i am willing to bet some playing around with curves, levels or contrast will make what i am referring to stand out."
3kqxgy9yvz,3336,good imaginative image well done the colors are great
xd883vnqjj,3337,more contrast could have really helped this image as well. everything seems too flat and monotonous.
55872cdks2,3338,would have liked to see a better balance between black and whites.
d5lrkbatsm,3339,love the greens.even here in fl at this time of the year it is hard to find green would like to know how you applied your sharpening.that is still eluding me.
h7cy5l0plp,3340,"i like the idea here, it just seems a bif fuzzy somehow. maybe a little sharpening could help"
h7cy5l0plp,3341,wow that is terrific balance. i think a bit of levels adjustment would really enhance the various shades of gray.
ven0q98rq6,3342,kind of bright image. maybe with more contrast would be better. interesting
ven0q98rq6,3343,"thats a really bright picture, almost too bright. good use of shadows."
ven0q98rq6,3344,"well done,white on white,nice exposure, from me!"
lzxoqqu6bm,3345,how do you keep the blue so clean.there is some grainpixils but not much?
zq1273x0ra,3346,"like the colors, comp and exposure very much. great detail as well."
zq1273x0ra,3347,"lovely photo.nice and soft appeal to it, very serene"
5063ip77rt,3348,id have also prefered the gamma a bit darker.
73v7tikve2,3349,a delightful and peaceful image with colors so rich.
73v7tikve2,3350,beautiful colors and amazing quality
g31zlk8b2w,3351,heshe looks super soft. baskets give a nice contrast.
g31zlk8b2w,3352,very cute yes lovely colors in the picture
j4t0u5mkse,3353,"lots of detail, nice shadows!"
j4t0u5mkse,3354,"realy cool, a god blac and white is almost unbeatable at showing feelings!"
k9a7n04lgm,3355,the darks are too dark and the lights are too light. in short too much contrast.
kzzybe5yce,3356,a bit of noise reduction and this would be a very nice picture
kzzybe5yce,3357,a little too grainy.wouldve been better if it were sharper and clearer
r7lptwmbkh,3358,"interesting, the monocromatic color is ok."
2k9ni6abcl,3359,beautiful work with the color and the reflections.
z8m1vi866q,3360,i like the use of sepia tones with this picture.
z8m1vi866q,3361,"i like the idea of the photograph but it was a bit blurry and perhaps a teeny bit too dark for me. im not sure if you downsized it or not, but there seems to be some loss of clarity to the image. an excellent content idea though!"
zkotlha6jg,3362,beautiful photo! a bit dark tho
zkotlha6jg,3363,great capture! wonderful contrast between the birds and the sky.i love it
fbmqmyp1oe,3364,nice clear photo.crisp and sharp
6jzyslxa0y,3365,"excellent colours,lighting, and contrast. great image."
28mozitmgt,3366,"good choice for bw, i like the detail, good contrasts."
u5om4o7glr,3367,something is quite funky with the color in this image
vz2i4zy3a9,3368,"tones are too dull, sharpness also an issue."
bwjvqm0odp,3369,"very smooth, makes the viewer feel relaxed as well. maybe just a little sharper?"
bwjvqm0odp,3370,love the smooth lines in this. i think it needs to be sharper with more white black contrasts though.
3a3k3sz352,3371,how is this restful just a standard portrait. well light though.
3khc49wj1r,3372,"maybe the green a bit overdone,"
6f0wm8opqg,3373,this is a neat photo. im not sure why you chose to go with the tungsten yellow tint rather than choose an appropriate white balance.
93yhi1d0bk,3374,"wonderful photo, i love the richness in the color, good clarity"
hl92fdv9c5,3375,"nice photo, just slightly grainy, but a good photo just the same.i like the tint"
0cg2u5x8ww,3376,"amazing play of light and shadows, good work."
0cg2u5x8ww,3377,excellent work. great contrasts and color.
hsmgxx0di7,3378,"holds my interest in some ways, i like the stark nature, but the unnatural colour cast doesnt work well for me."
hsmgxx0di7,3379,good photo! but the cloud colour is odd pt
p5a7zivifh,3380,interesting idea but the picture quality is poor.
8xq0rrrtxt,3381,"i think i would have liked htis more if it wasnt quite so blurred. still, the message is clear."
owrrb947ph,3382,excellent light and comp and choice of b and w
2wgkbe752i,3383,"maybe its too bright and colorful to convey a restful feeling, but the bug definitely is resting."
inanhl2zp9,3384,wonderful capture! beautiful colors and clarity.great job!
q1d4o8yyqo,3385,"imo, the shat has either to much contrast or is overly dark."
cjg6rkqraj,3386,beautiful shot.other than the overexposure on the couch.it looks good
cjg6rkqraj,3387,how adorable! black and white was a great way to set the tone in this pic!
rtves9ig3i,3388,very nice find. love the choice of duotone here.
rtves9ig3i,3389,"a little blurred, nice tones and mood, though"
nq4hspb11z,3390,very good photo.i love the color and lighting.very relaxed feel to it.
ovi8992f0m,3391,"nicely composed, nice choice on the coloring, she looks peaceful.this has a nicefeel to it.well done"
31k9jiqyy7,3392,"nicely composed, bw works well on this, has a nice misty look to it as well"
imqdr9yk4l,3393,these shells seem just about alive! nice vibrancy to the colors
26jlieyn9m,3394,"i like this! imho though, it looks a bit overprocessed. too colorful if there could be such a thing. gl."
26jlieyn9m,3395,"glas that someone else figured that inanimate objects can appear to be resting. this looks a bit overexposed, otherwise, good comp."
26jlieyn9m,3396,"cute photo.love the frog!creative.slightly grainy, but still good"
0flf988dxz,3397,great contrasts here.i like the lone red light.
y57ozm2gu3,3398,great colors and shades. sharpness is nice too. good job.
y57ozm2gu3,3399,"neat photo.i like the vivid colors, the texture, and the shadow."
hzgbpikp2q,3400,"cool shot.nice effect, i like the color and the softness."
hzgbpikp2q,3401,i like this a lot. very calm picture with nice coloring. good work!
a6k1pq2l0v,3402,"great capture, i like the shadow, good use of bw"
7jz0r7wykh,3403,great quality and nice contrast of colors.
n39t4xgz0d,3404,good portrait. a bit dark in monitor and motion blurred. maybe some levels adjust had helped.
05ppij4asp,3405,"great softness, good color."
nhqjmgsh7y,3406,funny quality isnt the best tho
e4k8zb8tjm,3407,definitely the most wonderful feeling of pure serenity! fantastic photo.definitely a from me!
3gg00914cv,3408,great repetition and lines in this. the colors are strange though. perhaps if the tones were lightened or something it would have helped.
3gg00914cv,3409,colors are a bit strange! very cool pic though
3gg00914cv,3410,"i like the trailing off crosses, good use of color."
bnc5gdp8if,3411,excellent subject.it appears to be a bit grainy though. i love dogs. they make wonderful subjects. gl.
bnc5gdp8if,3412,this is adorable! great shot.like the color effect.good job!
e1qzb5sctw,3413,"now i know why this pic stood out to me when i saw it in the thumbnails. it looks like the black angus commercials a restaraunt. great job, and a good win!"
vjo3ql2low,3414,"bw works well on this, good shadow work as well, composed well"
b9alwfk8h5,3415,"very funny photo.i like this one alot.good rich color, nice clarity"
b9alwfk8h5,3416,"hehe, great colors, good capture."
8l62lxw5m0,3417,looks to be too pixelated and blurry
8l62lxw5m0,3418,good idea but bad execution. this photo looks like it has been enlarged from a smaller image. the pixelation here is horrible.
00shuwi0ig,3419,"ooh . neat! it reminds me of trent reznor for some odd reason, this pic says a lot without yelling at you."
e1ne93zqet,3420,great effect except kinda grainy
lebz18s6m0,3421,"these colors are really dull, might have gone with bw on this. nice find."
1jt1q6zhpu,3422,nice shot.has a good vibe to it. i like the lines as well. good stuff
1tv5eqmz5i,3423,"good capture, bw is ok."
vdqjmaswdj,3424,not quite sharp enough imo but good capture
j13xd17f26,3425,a good clean capture with outstanding colors. bumping from to
j13xd17f26,3426,"sharp, colorful image. good job."
7h4o3i0a5p,3427,amazing color and quality. perfect .
zq31xxqi37,3428,"they seem a bit upset.nice work, its just a pity for the too bright parts."
1n8d6tha83,3429,"beautiful capture! i love everything about this one, particularly the detail that you managed to capture so perfectly."
onauxq20zx,3430,really good capture. nice detailing and the color is really good.
nostraeexr,3431,very sharp with lots of detail.great photo
qcgm3chbi7,3432,"good timing, and use of color."
mskypvwkjc,3433,ugh! poor thing! very unusual capture! sharp detalied
88da4prexi,3434,"cute little creatures. im guessing you dont have a zoo nearby? it has a slightly flat look to it, though. perhaps more interesting light would have worked a little better."
caton48ruh,3435,"interesting use of desaturation, just a tad dark for my taste."
exjhg2txc2,3436,points for humor.all else is pretty weak
w08qf0qk2t,3437,aww.wonderful image! love the softness.
zkadzx4ptq,3438,he looks very bored. nice job on the detail and exposure.
ma3zrln7sj,3439,nice and furry . very sharp. good cu
qpc7piwcq2,3440,cool use of light and imagery.
xphbi7jtkz,3441,"a little soft for my taste, but the dramatic colors are wonderful. excellent work."
k8irjpmvht,3442,this is wonderful. great capture and choice of tone.
k8irjpmvht,3443,very nice. the black and white suits this image i think.
k8irjpmvht,3444,"this has such a soft, peaceful look. it almost looks unreal. what touch ups did you do? nice!"
k8irjpmvht,3445,beautifull picture. loves the shadowlight contrast. look to me a bit over processed though seems too much denoised. still very nice.
u4utcn5p6z,3446,"looks a little too contrasty or neat imaged cant really tell, otherwise nice capture."
1kmbmhvzp5,3447,"beautiful! incredible detail, and the vibrant colors are just amazing!"
r3xmwmhi7b,3448,"have you tried adjusting the curves or levels of this image? even an autolevels and autocontrast could have improved here, but could spoil the warm light."
s6knjhbu3j,3449,"if ya coulda captured it without motion blur, itd be damn near perfect!"
0buj19buxa,3450,a difficult case for exposure and you controled it pretty well.
1n9vb8dxha,3451,nice captue. nice and sharp
di2s769lhk,3452,great capture. these shots can be difficult i guess due to the color and you got it.
sodrsvf2lh,3453,a very convincing capture with great detail.
ll8rfgzkuu,3454,whoa noise! try and work on that next time. there is way too much of it in this photo.
zt5rv8j69w,3455,nice exposure of highlights and shadows as well
64j7v0re0i,3456,dont you wonder what hes thinking? i like the light hitting his whiskers. nice contrast.
g1sdbjqo7k,3457,"touching and sad photograph.very good capture with a message.i like the duotone or sepia use here, it works well."
g1sdbjqo7k,3458,wow! there is such a feel to this picture! love the color change to this.
boxii08bn6,3459,great job on the exposure. good idea showing the two together. very nice.
6blocd302l,3460,very nice image. the comp is perfect but it looks a little over saturated.
vz2zxyi767,3461,interesting. maybe a tad underexposed. good.
q63stta03x,3462,"this photo is smaller than it needs to be. in spite of that it is a well composed photograph, i love the soft colors and peaceful feeling i get from looking at it. next time try to make it a little bigger and you will get a few more points."
fo6t95tfxi,3463,"nice work on this one. everything is very well exposed, even with what appears to be a very bright, sunny day. good job!"
3huzuqh4as,3464,nice contrast reminds me of this song.lol. ride the tiger you can see his stripes but you know hes clean oh dont you see what i mean
3huzuqh4as,3465,incredible capture. very sharp and lots of details.
rfbcihwgtw,3466,"beautiful capture with the ears out like that. sharp and clear and nice, rich tones. good job."
rfbcihwgtw,3467,a very dramatic capture without going with a lot of contrast. i like this a lot.
o8wv0th27z,3468,looks like too much noise reduction has taken all the detail out of this image
lkvdzrxs99,3469,he is very pretty! love his vibrant colors against the greens. looks almost like you caught him in the wild.
3n2gaijzxe,3470,wonderful tones and lines. bw is very effective.
nuuxjyi97g,3471,just a shadow of her former self.
0plge3iiyf,3472,"wothout the white pole, this would have been brilliant nice photo."
m1gf1fbk4j,3473,"i like the duotone, and the lines all work well in this."
m1gf1fbk4j,3474,just as an observation. hot job would may have been better expressed with this photo in color. the sepia tones everything down and makes a solemn feeling.
azgfe2hr0k,3475,"i dont think id want to stand out in front of those cars and taxis. some colors seem very true, while others are too exaggerated like yellow. the traffic cops facial features arent very distinct. rob the swash"
xpd9vn45q6,3476,little blurry but not a bad idea.
vq96wqzyc1,3477,"very nice image. it may have needed a tripod, i am not too sure. is it motion or grain noise artifacts that we see? it is dramatic and surprising well lit considering the circumstances. good work. morgan"
o4x63gvrn2,3478,good stuff here! the motion blur and movement of light really capture what they do through time very well.
o4x63gvrn2,3479,"awesome photo! looks kinda lke a multiple exposure. is it? if not, howd you do it?"
7ty7rqntpl,3480,interesting shapes and forms! might look real good processed as pure black and white.
gwnmm4og6f,3481,nice motion capture and wonderful tones. very fine work.
gwnmm4og6f,3482,the bw works well here. the motion blur gives your image an extra boost .
ezfd1ano0j,3483,a bit too much yellow for my taste.
swlk586xi4,3484,very good. powerful image. im finally beginning to see how some images look better in bw.
gp6ca88qv1,3485,clever. nice time exposure. im sure it was not easy to hold that pose.
jgn0tsmch1,3486,lol some would argue that the un is not much of an authority. but i digress.nice shot.i like the blue on blue effect.
jgn0tsmch1,3487,nice colour and good speed
g7aclf2zur,3488,"digitized, busy, and a reddish purple cast. nice pergo though."
jums8bvdfl,3489,"to me this is just funny portrait, an overexposed one at that. i really dont feel the authority emotion.but i think it is fun to look at."
k3m6k3q6lh,3490,"good idea, but the light is a little blown out."
uptns5byby,3491,quite dull. try playing with curves and saturation.
uptns5byby,3492,"nice , but too dark and no main object"
uptns5byby,3493,the contrast and colors are poor in my opinion
0g9grqzyj1,3494,"nice effect, though it appears a little dull. could use a bit more contrast or something."
afm3jdhjud,3495,looks too staged. too little contrast.
7usdyo8bte,3496,i like the capture of motion in this one.
7usdyo8bte,3497,"while i like this one for the colors and imagery, im not getting any feel for authority. i mean, for authority to be real, it must be respected. in your image, there is too much motion to indicate that the signal is being obeyed."
9yddieeryk,3498,nice image and use of motif. i like the lights but wish they werent so fuzzy.
wy133qojm4,3499,i wouldnt want to see what lurks in there come christmas. well presented but a bit blurry.
rkvmjg5cau,3500,"this image needs some work. the brilliant light could work as your message, but it is too overwhelming and messy."
xpid6kvyo7,3501,a very well taken image with great texture and color. bumping to
5b5goxn0j1,3502,i like the warmth youve created in this picture. i can just image being that age and making my list! great capture
tifw3ha6nr,3503,i really enjoy archetecture shots. very interestiong light source.
tifw3ha6nr,3504,nice image. well composed and great exposure. great work!
p41ag7xg6q,3505,my parents wont think of crossing this line. an eight year old is another matter. interesting image.
voyr7iklfp,3506,damn! this evokes an emotion.thats for sure. i think a tad more contrast would help. i like that it is rendered in black and white. powerful illustration! i hope its an photographic illustration! shudder
voyr7iklfp,3507,"same message couldve been setup many different ways this is not bad. a little dark, but maybe that adds to the drama."
voyr7iklfp,3508,"yikes, very disturbing photo.powerful image of something that happens way too frequently in the world today. b w adds to the atmosphere here. well done."
4nfcokbk42,3509,"processing a bit coarse, with obvious halos around the contrasty portions."
h4y2g72aq4,3510,great observation. beautiful colors. i really like this image.
ouie17xc5t,3511,"this image feels alitle lakcing. colors are a ittle flat, and there is little of interest."
rjg3o1m5th,3512,nice. colors on the signs are a little dark.
3j1f2h0ic1,3513,"the image is a bit too dark for my taste. with the signs stacked like this, i dont feel that they are blocking anything. if it had just been two, great, this, notsogreat."
6ptvoxruj3,3514,great exposure and focusdof id maybe like to dodge a
mfdo52fyr8,3515,"oh, could be such a nice photo, but the quality is just nonexistent."
gqadzrupbc,3516,authority? bit of a stretch. also suffers from overexposure in places.
v9e6nzszjy,3517,a litle to much neat image. not all that bad though.
9djonq8qln,3518,this is a very beautiful capture with stunning colors! good job.
9djonq8qln,3519,"i cant really link this to authority. perhaps the suns light controlling us? wait, theres a link. ."
v0kj6kzgyb,3520,good use of selective desaturation. makes the image rather spooky.
v0kj6kzgyb,3521,"technical sharpness, exposure, and contrast is good."
5lw1nqu2d1,3522,"no great picture but.you entered, its thought provoking and it is to me the most positive idea presented. that, authority is not only restrictive, but permissive as well. that, there are green lights as well as red."

6fc2ynfeee,3550,"cute pic, and i understand the sentiment, but is it really a suitable message to convey in an ad?"
l2y4m2iqe3,3551,"note to selfgo with clean and shiny, not mysterious and artsy."

79d8zltzeg,3571,"the photo has the feeling of too much sharpening, especially in the furry feathers. i see this because there are some very brights parts the the feathers that look unnatural."
4y1lvpps71,3572,"lovely fawn. great stillness. these guys are always moving, and in limited light are usually blurry. good job! ."

wcjejx43bh,3595,"if i didnt know the assignment was backlighting, i would say this is too dark. but even given that, i think it is still too dark. nice effort though, looks like a good bit of work went into this one."

bfkms0kqwh,3599,have they been arguing again? good idea. nice use of light
el63wnteot,3600,looks a little oversharpened. reducing it would prevent the haloing around the trees and reduce the harshness of the noise.

2mnxmpd2bo,3607,too much light? very good expresions and i love her hands over the knees
w41dqx35ko,3608,thats creative.looks more like ancient ruins than cards when i first looked at it. might be able to use stronger contrast though?
bopnauyp37,3609,the front is too well lit to get any worthwhile backlighting effect.
5cs05xzimx,3610,"this is the best image that i have seen. not only did you freeze action, but you captured some great backlighting, and the subjects have great exposure."
5cs05xzimx,3611,"just a tad too bright but super action, great expressions."
tbv4cvjpml,3612,repeating shapes make this work on several levels. the obvious backlighting is a perfect example.
cjlw3rv6f6,3613,"a nice idea, but your forelighting completely cancels out most of your backlighting."
s0if2omcjh,3614,"a nice idea, but i think you took the exposure too far and the photo looks a bit grainy."

3ns7ib8yqu,3665,unusual protrait makes a terrific example of backlighting.

ww9c99ua2j,3675,id have to agree with aznym on this one.they must have been blinded by the light
w031sxrepg,3676,the pose is priceless but the amount of light seems excessive.

yli32uun02,3704,good idea.imo its too much red in the orange. i would have desat the red tones a little bit orand displaced them into cyan or green a bit.

v08e8m1uoo,3728,"nice image except for the flare, and it looks grossly overprocessed. i think you over did it majorly with the sharpening. luckily you can correct that if you decide to pring the image or display it elsewhere."
onu9vwkjl1,3729,love the color and soft tones here. wonderful macro. one of my tops.
b71ufxcds5,3730,"nice glow it would be tempting to try more contrast but this makes the light softer, very pleasant."

6vp6rdysoa,3781,im sorry but this photo is way too pale.
f6e5zee7yv,3782,nice image just wish there was a little more contrast for added impact
g4e36tg14x,3783,the white light causes distraction
kxf6zo7xyt,3784,"great atmosphere, worthy of a movie poster!"
edlb3evl30,3785,i cant seem to find a focuspoint. lots of noise as well.
y52fmr8c0u,3786,it was a dark and stormy night. i like the duotonish look.
y52fmr8c0u,3787,"nice idea. i think if there was a little more contrast, this print would be a lot stronger."
9oxp0gbq3h,3788,great idea. could use a little more contrast to really make the photograph pop!
9oxp0gbq3h,3789,i love how you chose to have it in black and white. and the shells just look really mice. i really like this photo.
koe1h6fbof,3790,nice image nice idea just lacks some much needed saturation and sharpness.
78s6rplgmc,3791,whrer are the highlights that backlighting offers?
78s6rplgmc,3792,nice and sharp but the overal image is a tad grey and if you looked at this backlighting wouldnt be the first thing you would think of.
ay8ud3c0tb,3793,clever and imaginative. good use of backlighting.
ay8ud3c0tb,3794,"i dont know if that was intentional, but the outlets look like faces that spit out the sparks. the colors and details are really good."
syidjq06q5,3795,wow thi picture is great i love how its in black and white and just everything. very cool
syidjq06q5,3796,nice image nice and sharp with good exposure not too sure if black and white helps here though.
9rbk75173z,3797,nice image nice exposure on the whites just looks a tad flat
t82rzdmwpe,3798,"this look strange, maybe too much noise reduction? im not sure."
eh8eaikvd7,3799,nice image like the cool greens and nice sharpness.
2nwb42pz11,3800,i love the contrast of the warm lights and the cool skywater.
8uqz0dckua,3801,thats rich. great colors.
8uqz0dckua,3802,nice image like the tones lacking a little sharpness which these images must be to work
0x51wv1g87,3803,nice image like the tones and good sharpness
3l8lq1fnk8,3804,this might have possibly worked better if you had been able to filter some of the harsh light from behind. a bit to much blowout detracts from the image.
3l8lq1fnk8,3805,nice colors but your highlights seem blown and totally without any kind of detail.
n1tcsdzbai,3806,nice image maybe a little flat and grey needs some more contrast and richer blacks.
ax2dp020k8,3807,"great idea and stunning image, i really like the oddly dreamlike quality with these colors."
yp7j6bv055,3808,what a shame its not sharp. the backlighting is very pretty
jxathom635,3809,nice image just wish the trap was sharp. needs to be much closer as the web gets too lost in the image which looks heavy with blacks.
n5cpbsaqmu,3810,thats close. pity the wings are not sharp.
oeh554zum9,3811,nice image nice clean sharp image.
paucli4ed5,3812,looks a little artificial in the constrast boost
aaqwtmm0u5,3813,nice idea but very flat and unsharp let this pic down
v1wrh606w3,3814,good idea. nice backlighting. love the detail of the orange.
v1wrh606w3,3815,"nice orange tones, some blown highlights though."
8j3jc7eku5,3816,beautiful blue tones in this image and you captured the light well. very nicely done.
kd80abltug,3817,well this is not a bad photo but its just too dark for my taste.
f2jzy696cx,3818,nice image interesting feel to this maybe just a tad harsh on the light.
r3m2rxjob3,3819,nice image great glow to this and i like the blue tones.
gp1hx7h8kc,3820,nice capture of natural backlighting.
17i2pp9u7c,3821,nice image nice colours the backlighting is a little harsh though and unnatural looking.
sc4dtfps2m,3822,"haha whats the deal with these things. well done tho, nice colour."
i1nnsoggv1,3823,"wow, so interesting. beautifull colors."
ocgk1zzxw5,3824,nice idea. i like the contrast of warm and cool colors.
42am2nyajh,3825,the white looks like it is washed out and the lghting is wrong
bhgioqfdcf,3826,i would have preferred the building to have more light on the front but the clouds are very nice
18ao06zf4l,3827,"like the colors. are these the ikea ones, by the way?"
ze0j7yo61u,3828,i dont see backlighting as a main technique used in this photo
qqu5evub8l,3829,"yeah, didnt really expect this to do well theres not really anything to it imo. it also looks more like its a frontlit sepia picture its not."
mbooqf5o6m,3830,"another amazing use of light for your beautiful subjects, rob. not a bad finish either. front page! woot"
0bwc3ayp2m,3831,beautiful colour and light. i love the hairy stem.
o6c8zrhvzd,3832,i like it. great green colour and good setup.
j33f1hurzb,3833,"good job on the backlighting, pretty glow to this."
3voqilbnxb,3834,a bit overexposed for my tastes. interesting colour choice.
fks2a7enjc,3835,"the viens add too much noise to the photo, but at the same time give it some characteristics."
zz4arsizh6,3836,interesting approach. maybe having the light directly behind the krypton would make it pop more if possible?
j0cpanr2ev,3837,"i like how its a sharp contrast, but then it is made soft around the edges of the orange.thats cool."
21x59m2sie,3838,nice subjects. photo feels a little grainy.
4d85opq7g6,3839,i like your journal. nice clean image and colors. happy experimenting.
xbwhso0kbe,3840,nice use of colour well done
gbv7k69jl5,3841,"i dont really get the whole using woodies in pictures thing, but i like the idea and you did use backlighting."
23vyjk1y8i,3842,"i find this intriguing. you have certainly ennobled the tupperware, and its texture and colour flirt nicely with the limes."
zfnn1r7693,3843,"i gotta say i would have loved to see the natural color of the lemonorange, although this effect is cool"
zfnn1r7693,3844,nice details. not sure that the blue helps much.
zfnn1r7693,3845,"i like the idea, but i feel the colors are too washed out. would have liked to seen some nice blues and yellows."
zyo5e78nng,3846,"very pretty, the play of light and shadow here is nice."
a8gc7o9tbu,3847,"the image could be a bit bigger, px, which would allow more detail."
a8gc7o9tbu,3848,"the image can be kb which will also allow more detail, try altering the compression when saving or the save for web if using photoshop."
gmk2wy200v,3849,very pretty and soft. lovely colors and detail.
tq9dmauehf,3850,"yeah, this is a winner. truly exceptional colors and shapes."
uk8blz6udz,3851,excellent use of bw to give this impact. a fave.
hs7py3mplf,3852,great timing on this capture. classic look.
1kqrqux9zx,3853,nicely lit to produce an interesting graduation of white and yellow.
u4299y4cws,3854,"great use of light, but kinda bland and lacks thought in my opinion"
bikssp7ees,3855,"great contrast and colors, maybe a bit busy."
t7alp6ar3b,3856,i was one of you s.i love this image.great color and drama.really ugly but somehow beautiful at the same time
qh669rrjx5,3857,"good capture, but to me this is not real backlighting, most of the light comes from above"
sk4jzmblp0,3858,leading lines. ruleofthirds. not to mention the exposure and sharpness. .
jjwz6b0v8u,3859,nice texture patterns. also like the graduated coloring.
yxiy9ymkc8,3860,and the winner is.my pick for the blue . irenem ?
nvs6luauan,3861,really nice job on the backlighting.
56u1jy3npv,3862,a nice candid that could use a touch more contrast imo.
msb751umjg,3863,a little to dark imo but still a cute clich as you call it
msb751umjg,3864,cute. the photo seems a bit dark to me? could be my monitor. i like how the feet are a teeny bit out of focus.adds a little movement.
zr9s5ija0n,3865,a good idea but the imag is very noisy and could be sharper too.
jpwfxrs9cg,3866,would be nice to have a bit more exposure on the greenery.
slk1ta2fre,3867,too bad about the shadow being where it was. nice vivid colors without being overdone.
k28x92d8i9,3868,love the sepia tone. this definitely shows the determination of little kids.capturing him in mid climb. cute.
61c79zlpc5,3869,really nice and sharp but not a lot of backsides.
61c79zlpc5,3870,nice catpure. excellent colors and clarity.
mktl52d5i8,3871,"nice balance of light, good idea"
vr288wf7ks,3872,awesome. very creative.lovely colors. great.

phfmsxxl6x,3874,great processing and color tones.
9z4h0z0y14,3875,i normally hate pics of flowers but theres something about this. slightly sharper wouldve been great imo
8mw1lxh65d,3876,"color, detail, comp.nice work."
m6wm1dfqua,3877,i guess i dont get what you are trying to do here. technically its quite busy and a bit soft.
m6wm1dfqua,3878,nice motion. although the photo is a bit busy.
m6wm1dfqua,3879,watch your saturation levels here you are blooming on your greens and blues. other than that i really like it.
a1hpsk1srp,3880,aww. sweet. i think ii would like it more if there was a warming filter applied. the girls white dresses look a little blue to me.
a1hpsk1srp,3881,sweet and classic. nice soft light.
0js99czmbc,3882,not sure if you gained anything through your choice of selective desat.
0js99czmbc,3883,nice use of desat. love the spots on their ears.
0js99czmbc,3884,great selective desat. meow.
tsv27n1alm,3885,ha! cool idea! colors are very moody. i like it.
j1f69u5uie,3886,wow great picture. i love the color in this picture. it really makes it pop. is the color naturel or did you add it?
j1f69u5uie,3887,i like the bright colors and the detail on the bug. the whites seem to have burned out though
j1f69u5uie,3888,"a little bright, maybe a little oversaturated, but an interesting photo,"
2pv6ommb5w,3889,great idea. tough light to work in but a nice comp.
4ckeaavnqe,3890,interesting. good clear sharp image.
iloqmltq0a,3891,good light and colors. a little more movement would have been nice though.
2sookuep6t,3892,very nicely done. the cool color balance gives this a nice feel.
k76kfkkx6o,3893,"fabulous, love the capture here, nailed the timing, and nailed the bw tones here, wonderful. added to faves."
k76kfkkx6o,3894,"deb, just happened upon this beauty. wow. i have to agree with the bw gal at heart, the bw rocks."
k76kfkkx6o,3895,i like the bw better as well. good job!
k76kfkkx6o,3896,"woo hoo! you go, gal! for the record, i much prefer the bw version to the color. sorry, daniel"
k76kfkkx6o,3897,"fantastic photo, and good work with the tones. great choice over the color."
k76kfkkx6o,3898,im so glad this ribboned. i like the bw version better too and i probably would have given the color version a instead of a .congtatulations.
k76kfkkx6o,3899,this is a really great photo. good judgement to make in bw too. works very well.
k76kfkkx6o,3900,well deserved! funk was wrong this time imho. the bw is much more powerful.
k76kfkkx6o,3901,"wonderful capture, a very classic feel"
k76kfkkx6o,3902,"very nice image. bw looks awesome and it oozes such warm feelings , great work"
sevp9c0j9g,3903,i cannot believe you guys did not at least swap the clothespins around. lol the subtle difference in color between the two pics is interesting.

f5skxbcxlt,3905,"very interesting photo, good light and detail."
y4xiov546g,3906,"hey, . very well done! nice detail and the tones are wonderful."

2uz65mwojy,3909,"nice image, good bw conversion, good tones"
rsqbgcs64m,3910,good detail on the brid and nice colors too.
eahp03px6e,3911,a little too dark for my tastes. cant see the tubes and all in the set.
eahp03px6e,3912,its a little dark and a little busy and im not sure i get what you are trying to say with it.
8c56ffw74z,3913,awesome. its so clear. colors are great. processing is phenomenal.
pndtdnjku6,3914,dont do it! jk nice blur and the lighing seaping through the windows is great

vrlvehd4h4,3919,nice idea but i would have liked to see a little more detail on this fine instrument.
q0vdtratin,3920,clever use of light and shadow.
q0vdtratin,3921,nice shadow effect youve created and good bw work.
b53c68lrkd,3922,funny. your colors are too vivid for my taste. im assuming you boosted the saturation. i think its a litte overdone.
b53c68lrkd,3923,"lol, this is the best picture! i love it so much! the colors, kids, idea, etc. perfect!"
b53c68lrkd,3924,i love the idea and your execution. it just has a little too much contrast for me.
4z76kjb0ak,3925,"dont know if that is the natural colors or not, but that is cool. i like the contrast of the colors and the details present. very nice work."
4z76kjb0ak,3926,wow wonderful texture and colors!
kyvdi8gcvo,3927,nice candid! the bw is a great choice!
4ihzciurmp,3928,i feel this need a little more sharpness on the front object
vswha9z9ct,3929,"very nice picture hard to capture, the only thing i wish is a bit more color."
vswha9z9ct,3930,"nice capture, but it seems just a touch flat, colorwise."
0lopwe7s4m,3931,great bw. just a touch dark but not too bad.

0l4cxch3on,3935,haha. cute. love the bw choice here.
yaw0szqc5a,3936,"one more problem the photo seems oversharpened. there are halos around the lines where dark meets light, and they seem unnatural."
48hma2fke0,3937,"flash is harsh, muted colors."
dihq3c996s,3938,"interesting idea, execution is good. the colors are quite vivid."
dihq3c996s,3939,very beautiful. nice colors and great pp

o2fvergwbw,3942,"nice idea good captured! a tad too dark in all, imo"
74l0fjdr57,3943,i hope ya dont get killed by the selective desat nazis
y3hqm1ce0v,3944,gave you for this.i love your b and w work.great duotone
y3hqm1ce0v,3945,very cool! love the lines duh! and the ever so slight jungly texture thingie you have going on here.
y3hqm1ce0v,3946,the kind of grainy look works well in this photo.
th4teec6s6,3947,heehee! great idea and better execution! love the clarity and detail on this!
z247827p1u,3948,bw works very well here. love all the shadows. great leading lines too.
jxlugojoeg,3949,"thought this might be yours. the acid tones, the light and shadows looked quite familiar"
stg7okcplh,3950,fantastic processing. the clouds are ominous and add to the mood of the photo. lovely.
9f69fi00vo,3951,the mistery of this image does the picture. very well composed with a pleasing atmosphere. way underated!
9f69fi00vo,3952,this is nice. i love the texture of the ground.and the motion of the feet. works very well.
q2y30whthd,3953,exceptional black and white.superb tones! love it!
3eziz7ae2l,3954,nice detail and light but a little oversaturated i think unless you have ladybirds in a different color than where i live
f7r7cf25ei,3955,way oversharpened see the wite lines around your dark lines? and the processing isnt to my taste.
uuuqvq27il,3956,nice idea but the colours are a bit flat imo
e02618en0o,3957,i like the moonlit feel to this. very smooth and vast as well.
e02618en0o,3958,not sure if the coluoring youve applied does anything for it. id have preferred this in straight black and white.
31kzfbp5on,3959,great pic looks like a classic photo.
8jtoeqsj3c,3960,nicely photographed. nice comp and color tones.
8jtoeqsj3c,3961,great color. i wish more of her was in the light though. she seems to be mostly in the shadows.
sl4xsohj5e,3962,very cool light and dof.very nice photograph!
3qo8outq4o,3963,the stark contrast of this gives it a sterile clinical feeling
ehb42u2afz,3964,beautiful. for once a selective desat. picture that actually works and enhances the image.
7xodx08v7n,3965,beautiful baby.nice comp and contrast. shadows are a bit overwhelming
7wm7yjp0m0,3966,if this were my daughter shed be there bc of a time out! lol! nice execution good work with the contrast btw her e the action.

pfmrl1q7ea,3969,nice lines here. bw is an interesting choice.since peacocks are so colorful.
6f79cy6461,3970,"unusual interesting, a nice feeling of motion in this"
zqls71mj8g,3971,"maybe my computer, but this is a tad too dark for me, although i like the pose and the idea."
8hjllpiwyy,3972,cool shadows and what a bright color!
8hjllpiwyy,3973,i love the dramatic color. the lines work very nicely. i love the punch of white at the bottom. nice work.
1mmny1d419,3974,interesting pp though the colors of the backlights look a bit over saturated and unreal
1mmny1d419,3975,i guess without the selective desat it would be too busy. nice pp!
ujwywpdhnd,3976,"wonderful color and clarity.very, very cool macro!"
ujwywpdhnd,3977,he just looks kinda stuck. good capture and colors
ebn6h28unv,3978,beautiful! the colors are bright and clear. i like the light used here. you have a nice a job with this!

hpbfeevk4m,3984,nice. the bricks could stand a little more contrast imo.
tlqv7qwr7v,3985,"good contrast between the purple and green, and good details"
tlqv7qwr7v,3986,"lots of these, it seems. i like the hikey detail complementary colors"
bkft6wtphu,3987,the postprocessing its closer to the limite. maybe too much ni
r1bi0biv8q,3988,a wonderful image indeed. full of quiet mystery and love.
9a3bb3ro5o,3989,i like all the ropes and lines here. but the image is a bit too orange in my opinion.
9a3bb3ro5o,3990,"i like the stern, but the coloring seems a bit odd to me. i dont think it is particularly effective in this, though if it were turned down just a touch, it might be."
fhtqwkw4lg,3991,"very rich feeling , great colors"
fhtqwkw4lg,3992,very peaceful feeling. nice exposure on this.
txzz6xpr3o,3993,"comp, colors, detail, all sharp."

txzz6xpr3o,3995,"im seeing too much obvious ps work here, especially around the edge of the cloud."
3zh3cauqf1,3996,nice soft colors but your hightlights seem to burn out a little.
wv624ytews,3997,good contrast against sky.well composed pic.
4v2m97so4k,3998,"very good black and white. very nice clarity, a tiny bit more light would be good."
3t7ixegnyz,3999,nice idea but the color is off. too much yellow in the picture.
i8g2ec6h96,4000,"i like the arrangement and colors, but i dont care for the posterization effect"
vbk5h1yrit,4001,"this was good for a laugh and is a really neat photo as well as being funny. school does tend to go through pencils, doesnt it?"
vbk5h1yrit,4002,id like it even more with colored pencils
yvvatvibsk,4003,the clarity and the color on this picture is unbelieveable!
yvvatvibsk,4004,"very good shot.wow this is nice. love the pose, light and colors. good work."
5fbre4925p,4005,"i like the way you used the sort of monotone color scheme to bring together a lot of objects, it works well to solidify your image as a whole."
3lowyr0eow,4006,"someones about to get in trouble, eh? nice clean picture, very good clarity and colors."
t0tuwqb8bf,4007,nice and sharp. those are some old books. great color.

c3nral6vet,4012,great colors and arangement of the subjects in your photo
fkf5537ozk,4013,"artistic and unique idea, but a wee bit blown."
eugin959ca,4014,the quality of the photo is not so good and there are white dots all over it
97a7gboy0d,4015,"i like the picture, but i dont love the blue cast. and if im being picky, it would be nicer if the nailsfingers were bit more manicured."
97a7gboy0d,4016,"except for the heavy bluish cast, i like this. is that an illustration of the teacher?"
4b2qcqts4c,4017,this falls a lil flat for me. and your shadow cast on it darkens it even more.
y2ol64loa8,4018,nice pops with the pink and blues and orange
zoqrzpsv8g,4019,nice way to show off the new sharp pencils.
dlmudftna9,4020,"ugh, the whole tone of this makes me dread school. interesting how you convey that feeling"
dlmudftna9,4021,"image looks flat, some levels or curves adjustments can fix that."
epczqfrdvq,4022,its a bit grainy and thresholdly. at the bottom other than that good photo!
epczqfrdvq,4023,i like the color contrast.and sharpness.so good!

e5zd0heg4i,4030,great concepttitle. very glad for your blue.
e5zd0heg4i,4031,heehee.very cute idea. its kind of flat though.
5rs1nopc9x,4032,"oh dear. yup, thats pretty bad good light, but feels a little over sharpened though."
m4cobmse1r,4033,you really need to overexpose a bit when there is a lot of white in the image.
3dawwcx781,4034,"for me, pounds would be a resolution that went splendidly! nice pic."
k0qyhtdcgu,4035,"louellen, your editing has become much better and this image shows it. id love to see a little more contrast in the image to make it pop but otherwise well conceived."
eakrleir6s,4036,really bad. color and contrast sriking. good job!
nqusjj5yq0,4037,"good detail, but the fist doesnt look clenched enough to display anger, it looks relaxed"
n7gcqj1c3m,4038,yikes! the detail on this is profoundly creepy
hmzhzmfu3u,4039,"sorry, this is a bit too black for me, you loose so much detail in the shadows."
j6t719v7kk,4040,"a bit soft and overblown highlights. still, i like it"
cr7zfrmmnx,4041,the image seams flat to me. iwould have liked more contrast and moodier light.
0pw1uueait,4042,cool capture of an interesting building. the bw gives a good gritty feel.
s4yyrr8iic,4043,nice and sharp. nice comp and shadows are excellently softened.
yavzaf42ys,4044,the image suffers from excessive noise
2nhvr25l6f,4045,i like the idea but their is too much noise in the photo
xkdsj29wf1,4046,i really like the light and the chose of color
qoyc3kmjt1,4047,white balance? great image lots of tension but his hands are a funny color.
j6dxulk1k6,4048,great usage of light.
5hq3t3zm9s,4049,great exposure and color saturation!
xk57vujcxo,4050,"the most dreaded of all balance. cool idea, great execution."
ed6owqtz6f,4051,dosent really show balance. looks a little purple as well.
seb5ismajw,4052,"wonderful photo, great idea, excellent use of color."
ui12h96xd6,4053,good image but probably not blatant enough in showing balance for this forum.
ui12h96xd6,4054,i like it. it could be alittle sharper but the softness suits the feel. i can see what you were trying to achieve.
n3b70a64w9,4055,outragous color which is good but isnt real blatant in showing balance.
eit0t0kqkz,4056,it is the light effect that does that i think which is a shame as you have gone to a whole lot of effort to produce this
eit0t0kqkz,4057,something about this reminds me of a goldberg device in a tom and jerry cartoon.
561wryanq4,4058,"great advice and photo has a nice illustrative quality to it. the lighing seems somewhat bright on the figures, but that may just be the way i see it. nice work."
ki611qraft,4059,wonderful action freeze. photo is very clear and well composed. it really doesnt represent balance to me but a solid nontheless from me.
ki611qraft,4060,this is just nice ro look at. good detail.
9sbiijs5cs,4061,"sure does show balance and has great clarity and color , well done."
5ojpxyju65,4062,"this is a great idea but the colour seems off, unless you intended for it to look bluish. a white balance adjustment is called for here."
8kqf88w829,4063,"excellent idea, probably not the best way to show balance but i still like it."
n7whm36cla,4064,"elegant and beautiful depiction of grace, balance, and poise. well done! o"
8hgh16c4c4,4065,good image that shows balance well and has excellent colour and detail. well done
il1dt22hbp,4066,the illusion of balance is a good idea but i think it wasnt pulled off that good in this image.
3yefkeg6pt,4067,simply beautiful.wonderful contrast of light and dark.
3yefkeg6pt,4068,"great timing. dark enough to capture reflections, yet light enough to capture clouds."
eqal1uq9n4,4069,"love the colors, nice idea, but i do agree about the watch and sharpness."
fxvajss4d8,4070,just not enough balance for my taste but a good architectual image all the same.
fs3mc13f4q,4071,good image shows balance but not sure of bw for this one.
fs3mc13f4q,4072,great b w photo. excellent contrast.
0nj1mhsge6,4073,"the swing requires more balance than it is attributed it. of course, we get use to it pretty quick and then dismiss the dexterity, but it entails balance all the same."
is6d2gs9qb,4074,interesting image with plenty going on but iam struggling to see balance.
emp5l8tcmq,4075,"nice colors, nice balance but not enough in it to keep the viewer intrigued."
r1dl7bpxpc,4076,"ok, i know the song, and this picture represents that verse great. but i dont see balance."
7iw4av3xct,4077,mm maybe pushing the balance thing a bit.
7iw4av3xct,4078,certainly does have color balance and it is a nice image aswell.
2pxkhms7dt,4079,sorry i can not see balance but nice macro never the less.
af956f0emo,4080,"very nice image has light, balance and intrigue well done."
af956f0emo,4081,hmm.i have fettish for silhouttes sp and dark blue skies.really neat!
s0tecmvi1w,4082,"this needs just a little more light. neat pose, and you setting whatever that line is is a grat idea."
8wexim5jt9,4083,"nice photo, beautiful building. i love the color you used."
vbuqyxjdq0,4084,"this is more a graphical representation, however, it is well done and the soft gray makes the image more tender."
p30asanw6o,4085,good idea just a little unbalanced for my taste.
fpkiyuxhgh,4086,"i predict that most wont like this metaphysical definition of balance, but i really like it. unique."
fzgfq3w3hi,4087,beautifully lit.suits the bw format well.
1z199mxfqx,4088,i loved this shot.expected it to do much better. love the grain and the sepia.excellent work! o
1z199mxfqx,4089,"good decision to go for bw , as it helps to keep distractions down to a minimum in a busy image."
i56gk3n299,4090,great photo. excellent example of displaying movement.
809snj23tw,4091,beautiful! i adore this picture the color and crispness of it
809snj23tw,4092,way to postediting to my taste. the picture should be nice before all that burning a duotone. a anyway
ydx89huce5,4093,"very nice capture. it appears to me to be overprocessed, though. the neatimage ? makes some areas look too smooth and unnatural."
nshfcgxuwy,4094,"i like the monochromatic color scheme, very subtle, and the contrast is great. the light coming through the wings is definetely the highlight of the picture."
8gzzphd2dk,4095,extra pointage from me for originality and pure weirdness.
yfnnumez7p,4096,lovely colourful fun photo.
yfnnumez7p,4097,great idea but the processing kills it unfortunately. oversharpening has created halos and the saturation has been pushed too much
wk8hxr3uxd,4098,should have done better . great colors but i think the blur on the blue done the damage
wk8hxr3uxd,4099,particularly nice colour arrangement.
qnv7vmtgym,4100,i like this image though i dont normally like the selective desat. thing. even though i actually used it on mine this time.
jsolll2vzd,4101,. nice reflections. colors are a bit pale.
wk6gixl2dd,4102,"good colors, i had an idea close to this that i didnt use."
qpe17xfpd0,4103,"cute. might need a slight levels adjustment.seems a little dark, not a lot, but a little."
h3bhfzh1y3,4104,thats a lot of white balloons. great idea and well executed.
lhu44bfdcx,4105,"nice photo,but wouldve looked better if the baloons were colour."
9gmppcecle,4106,i would love to see another treatment of this with nice bright colors! i do like this one however just would like to compare.
9gmppcecle,4107,"nice idea and good postprocessing, but not the best pov you used"
9jhm294gh6,4108,"this is so cute, nice choice on the selective desaturation."
n1h0gv1fih,4109,uh oh i wont mess with a pitbulls balloons!
jerfy2syru,4110,i like the soft overexposed look. very nice.
mfy2590uk4,4111,nice contrast mood effective.
0d2bmnltvr,4112,"love the very highkey look! a really adorable image, and the soft colors are perfect for it."
075uzz7dur,4113,"thats adorable, nice desat"
6j5a6zgxc2,4114,"i thought this was a cute idea, rosemary. the colors you captured are so pretty!"
hib4t29jxx,4115,"a bit soft and grainy, but extra pointage for the great idea."
ft2ie4itsk,4116,this has a light and girly feel to it that works. it makes me think of target commercials for some reason. i like it.
n3t6utwbfa,4117,a more realistic treatment of colors would emphasize the surreality of the treecow.
frdotl9290,4118,"fantastic light, leo!"
d0yxaxe3mq,4119,such vibrant colors! such a feeling of pure joy conveyed! well done
f432gytjho,4120,"this is awesome, cole. great selective desat."
f432gytjho,4121,"i love when a photograph has the power to make me experience something physically, like dizzy, or in this case unbalanced. looking at this, i feel like i might be about to tip over."
f432gytjho,4122,is there anything particularly significant about the number of red balloons? you just need more and youll have a hit song from the s
f432gytjho,4123,"awesone image, great bw."
f432gytjho,4124,"kind of weird for the sake of weird, but well done. one of the few examples where selective desat works well. nice."
ilqpmlvyux,4125,a little bit sloppy on the selective blurring.
5s952rake6,4126,loving the colors. a standout image.
inpv0pg0hj,4127,"what a great idea, almost the opposite from the folks who used the desat approach, this is much nicer"
un20xjuekm,4128,"pink, plump and luscious.yum. i gave you an"
20nevr0ymp,4129,ill take the purple one. i promise i will take good care of him
eyhvmmj1su,4130,"clever. a little bit dark, but fun nonetheless."
84ltb7bot0,4131,it appears to have qite a bit of noice. did you over sharpen?
4ni9qw0o05,4132,"apparently, we are doing a little light reading."
0sx5mqw8ew,4133,"ooh, like exelent idea, like the string, blurr and contrast,"
g3rh97djr5,4134,lot of noise in your sky.otherwsie good image
6v4u8h7kkv,4135,somewhere before . nice soft appeal.
dfedhd56hj,4136,good to see that the commenters appreciated it love the blend of pastel colors.
x2itph3e86,4137,"cool idea, seems a bit oversharpened at the edges of the balloons"
9rkk4uw0ds,4138,this could have been a lot better if it wasnt quite as grainy. balloons just dont lend themselves well to noise.
6gtsyahyjm,4139,great idea just a bit blurry.
vicsa2q4pk,4140,ouch! bananas and sharp objects do not go together!
whkauqe78i,4141,"cruelty to animals lookout for the spca! nice idea, good exposure. model doesnt seem totally thrilled. ttle says it all."
bg75onxwqk,4142,nice idea and effective use of selective desaturation. great job.
bg75onxwqk,4143,"very interesting idea. good job of removing color. to me, the picture is a little bit grainy looking but you might have wanted that to set the mood for the photo."
vrypw71jq6,4144,"great contrast, but some of the yellow looks washed, still nice"
rpdztudwpv,4145,i think i really would have liked this picture if you had kept the bananas yellow and evrything else black and white
rpdztudwpv,4146,black and white works very well with this photo. great job.
rpdztudwpv,4147,"dont really stand out enough in bw, shame you couldnt have desaturated everything else except the bananas"
n7ix7cwf42,4148,strange yet interesting image. nice colour selection desaturation.
n7ix7cwf42,4149,nicely done. excellent contrast and clarity.
01lzfo1t9u,4150,bizarre and weird. i like it! fun use of motion blur.
iwa722eq8f,4151,mysterious. the blurring works well for the feeling of your image.
7a5ocsuwmr,4152,cute! colors are kinda dull.
x7bykbz4lv,4153,"fun effect. unique idea, and the iamge works for me."
hr3lufua5m,4154,this a very nice quality photo with some bananas in it.
qab71wi4le,4155,cute and original. maybe could be a bit sharper. still the idea is worth a
hzd9rergrs,4156,"i like the inventive idea and the unique light, good interest."
c98sa0ccpz,4157,"nice picture, good colors, very clear."
cq7uhcep67,4158,"i like the light tones in your image. the sepia tint gives it a warm touch, which is however broken by the farmers cold, hypnotic stare at the viewer. it makes me feel slightly unconfortable, as if he was saying so, you were trying to steal these?"
fybrdp4fj2,4159,"fun image. the tones and mood make this photo special. bizarre take, but it works for me."
nsc6kr63yh,4160,nice color but a bit flat in temrs of detail.
nsc6kr63yh,4161,more yellow wouldve made the contrast a little more potent
wcub8l8c1y,4162,how did you do this? did you exchange yellow for the dark shadow? nice effect.well done.
4zrikhs3sj,4163,"lots of fun, and good use of desaturation."
4zrikhs3sj,4164,nice selective desaturation work.
3gsom8yaev,4165,"very nice. great contrasts in color, textures, and lines."
49dloixrhh,4166,"cute lol, but slightly overexposed. a . exposure compensation needed."
4sypj0sy4j,4167,"excellent macro! i like the subtle way you brought the message across. took me a second look. simply executed, nice texture on the nanner."
b5nq2msex3,4168,comes off to me as very soft and a bit oversaturated. sorry.
10oftmzwca,4169,under the milky way! awesome bw
4ag36v1vjc,4170,sepia tones give this an ancient look and i like that.
adl6i16653,4171,hmm. i like this. nice and crazy. great colors and detail
kwbmsefzep,4172,ive just tried resaving your file using save for web and set to progressive in place of optimized andor embeded colour and now it seems fine in safari.
kwbmsefzep,4173,good photo. even the black and white fits this.
3fzaa91964,4174,"creepy photo, good interpretation. good bw choice"
1vk2zcj0jw,4175,very nice. colors are so rich and the reflections are nice.
f53ntmascq,4176,"neat idea, but i dont think that the lowres internet version does it justice."
av43s52ds6,4177,monochrome is perfect for this photo. good job.
ql12o54wa9,4178,"good sharp image, and i love the grungy feel.but just out of curiosity i didnt knock you for it what is her addiction?"
rhxe09ifjb,4179,i think it was a great idea to not give it full color. great job!
ywdjzddk78,4180,i love pictures of light shining through trees. very cool idea
vufi2aztpx,4181,"i still struggle to understand the basics of photo postprocessing. i didnt know how to get a k picture, neither that i could play with the quality."
vufi2aztpx,4182,this is very nice. clear and sharp and the colors are wonderful.
z5rgdhcl26,4183,"cute, main subjects could be a tad sharper."
hhcred3d3y,4184,"im looking at this on a laptop, which may not yield the best viewing but the colors look dull to me. is the white balance set properly, or perhaps an off exposure?"
3i4k8zahsp,4185,ill be very interested to learn how you accomplished this sort of coloration within basic editing rules.
l39pokg2vr,4186,reality check with this photo. very nice. id like to see it in sepia.
9ntbz51btc,4187,rolling? where is the implied motion? these look like the motionless pebbles. dont you hate nitpickers?
9ntbz51btc,4188,"those are very flat stones, lol"
3pf0pgq03w,4189,not very sharp and the light seems a little too harsh. nice red though.
lgyusctrun,4190,good grungy feel with the grain effect. nice take.
3d9pm1430e,4191,interesting collection of textures and shapes that would make a nice black and white. i like it in color too. nicely seen!
61jpfxvjsv,4192,hey.you didnt get anywhere near the brown. good work.
6g53qp1cao,4193,"i like the gritty feeling, but there seems to be something slightly off about this. like everything has a ghost effect."
3o7nv8fpv8,4194,well i see that you edited out your remark on giving you a in the last minute and i was too late to include it in my reply. however.ill keep my reply the same. looks like youre trying to change the tone of the discussion to make it look like im harassing you. well go complain.
i70gznj7gm,4195,"i like the image but, the reds are a bit off to me. maybe a little less saturation."
ho6ujaafmz,4196,kind of murky light.
wzlu0qgxrp,4197,love the tones and colors in this ir.
64dw78z6ha,4198,"needs more contrast, maybe more blacks would help."
nrox8n1y2d,4199,nice warm comfortable colors.
zlnremfnyj,4200,i think this is great idea that is lacking in execution. the glasses are a huge distraction on what you are trying to say.
bfvezhx1sc,4201,"on a roll, you are! front page twice this week. impressive! and you dont just have batteries sitting around?"
bfvezhx1sc,4202,"i like the shapes in this pic, well done, , contender for the bluey."
bfvezhx1sc,4203,"my pic for the blue, ill be surprised if this doesnt win"
ic4lfc15xu,4204,"its very busy here, but im glad to see that im not the only one wrestling with stroboscopic light. just wondering how many batteries you used here. it looks more than one to me."
sq6qjrngb2,4205,"i like the graphic quality of this, the repetitive motif."
l5hjs4a7mt,4206,light regression is interesting.
l5hjs4a7mt,4207,"very nice arrangement, like the shadows and light, it is just underexposed. too dark."
iuf05rbbhu,4208,judging by the spelling the blurriness may be a result of one too many wines?
b656r9ffc3,4209,"great idea, and models. a little fuzzy focuswise for my taste."
b656r9ffc3,4210,"maybe it is my monitor, but there is a bit too much noise in this photo."
q79t01irjj,4211,image quality better than many. overuse of sharpen leaving halos.
s1ejgm03cg,4212,great selective desat in this photo.
s1ejgm03cg,4213,"i love the idea of role reversal, however, this frightens me good photo though, and the saturation is perfect for the dark humor."
sje91zgmbn,4214,should have done better. powerful and all too true image. bw is a great shoice here.
sje91zgmbn,4215,"perfect bw levels, nice idea."
sje91zgmbn,4216,great use of symbolism in this picture but remember when dealing with black and white to increase contrast
g59opbhzr5,4217,"nice wooden bricks, nice saturation."
hx0jfrhcqu,4218,"good on topic, well made.emphasizing the hands maybe a little to much, the faces are bit gray. like it though."
hx0jfrhcqu,4219,"lol i dont see much of a battle, the fadeing of saturated to desatd doesnt really help this i dont think."
hx0jfrhcqu,4220,"i like the idea, but dont care much for the color of their faces."
v5m41mw1pr,4221,"sweet.great idea, i should try it! hehe. i like the use of selective color on the sticky note.it really adds interest"
1pwo7jkzix,4222,"does not compete well with others in this category, but image quality redeems in many ways."
e81zsg6kn2,4223,i think this is a good idea but the colour seems off on my monitor maybe too saturated
915m4hay5f,4224,yea some things are a distraction i like the way ouhave done this
dlbtritva0,4225,anyway congrads on the ok photo getting the blue ribbion.
c5x18gsfsl,4226,wow! this looks soo pink! nice overview and light!
c5x18gsfsl,4227,i love it! i wish it wasnt faked though. sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get a good picture. this is very funny picture. great angles and use of colors
wh9skr6eug,4228,"i really dont get how this has to do with battle of the sexes. unless its tring to say that women are crazy. as far as technicals, its much too dark."
9cto9d3f5j,4229,"i dunno, i see a lot of guys do that, particularly after they eat too much. jk. lovely portrait. nicely balanced."
optj2wzzoi,4230,i really dont care for the blur and noise.
optj2wzzoi,4231,"great idea, but the image quality isnt working in my opinion."
optj2wzzoi,4232,unclear by blur and unclear as to what is the intended depiction. no saving graces.
deki7xx6yp,4233,"i knew this was yours, and is excellent. i gave this the highest of the lot shame you missed the blue again!"
deki7xx6yp,4234,"witty idea! a tad too dark, but great photo."
hqqqb5q9hz,4235,stunning picture with great colors and detail
hqqqb5q9hz,4236,a bit too dark in the feathers for me. otherwise a great image and well composed.
h9m33zdx1s,4237,i love the idea of the conflicting colors great use of symbolism.
wradsibwm1,4238,whats the gray smear on his thumb?
wradsibwm1,4239,"there must be some good laughs to make this one. good contrast, well lit, like it."
rfaqo1yl0l,4240,so true.but to me it seems like girls have even more! hehe. nice use of color.
xnduf93lyq,4241,love the colors in this one. was this in a play?
h293gb8nep,4242,good choice using color to distinguish the sexes here although i must say you choice the wrong one as the victor. p
ryj6toskad,4243,"also, theres just too much stuff in the picture. too many colors. maybe if it was black and white it wouldnt be so busy."
99xxkg5hd9,4244,"i like the bluish tones, and the dodge and burn. nice work here"
99xxkg5hd9,4245,i absoltuely love this pic. one of the few original ones! the light on the mans foot kinda throws me off though.
p38glikx9d,4246,wow excellent idea and great execution. also wonderful use of light.
llad78v6ej,4247,"hey, i had been wondering how it would look with some more colour. great! what a good picture. funny too! nice work."
bbzb60k9ph,4248,nice use of natural backlighting
jumxuwvddv,4249,great representation of the line from the song!
tmg4ytkjz1,4250,"call me old school, but this looks way overprocessed and artificial. sorry, just my opinion."
tmg4ytkjz1,4251,"white halos on the trees, but the image is stronger than the processing."
tmg4ytkjz1,4252,"wow! very cool pov and nice leading lines. looks a little oversharpened though. however, i like it."
taf3nipnsb,4253,beautifully done.great tones and wonderful sharpness. the model looks prefect for the mood as well.
taf3nipnsb,4254,"awesome bw tones, really sets the mood too. excellent photo!"
ydsoc7enmw,4255,cant place the song this line is from.
pt4b6uhqso,4256,gorgeous colors and cloud formations.
h2d7dx0rx0,4257,love the bright colors and you captured a great gaze from the model.
cancsfgcfk,4258,i wish there was a bit more light in this theres a little too much shadow i think
e0tzinn1u7,4259,the use of bw and the movement really had impact to this photo. wonderful . just wonderful ! i love it !
0pbqubdgin,4260,superb ! i love the tone and clarity of this one. its really stunning !
bphuozpp5x,4261,"while this techically is not a bad photo may a bit dark, there is nothing at all here that says strawberries to me, sorry."
3pdak59ov9,4262,other i also would have done a bit of desat on the teeth to get rid of a bit of yellowing.
nfnovyc2uj,4263,"nice portrait, but her facial features could be a tad sharper."
fpzgq3ucy6,4264,my daughter gave me a fluorescent green longlimbed monkey recently. i love it and can relate to your photo. being a monkey chinese astrology i can fully enjoy your photo.
4kya1vwh6i,4265,"nice warm colors, like the grad."
4kya1vwh6i,4266,the whole photo looks cloudy for some reason
kiniwbgedz,4267,truly a fun image with blistering colors. bump.
h3xszlboby,4268,great detail . youre lucky to have a place like this to take pictures at .
g5npz50jn6,4269,"i think i would have chosen to emphasize some colors, rather than going for the true black and white looks, to show some of the cheer that is in the song."
oketrlvznp,4270,"muted colors not quite color, not quite bw are very intersting in this photo. gives it a little something extra for me."
ljf1rkich3,4271,"again, i think you had a really good, powerful idea. unfortunately, it gets lost in the darkness."
ljf1rkich3,4272,ooh. much potential here! just a touch too dark to really see what is there.
ljf1rkich3,4273,maybe a little too dark at the bottom of photo. good idea for the song.
c57wazf8l2,4274,"cool photo, good contrast, not sure how it is eleanor though"
c57wazf8l2,4275,which line? the whole song?
18mqthp2qy,4276,dark and touching. bump.
18mqthp2qy,4277,"good interpretation of the feel of the song, she does have that wistful look. the blurred foregrounds adds to the feel, nicely done!"
pcujv9c0xc,4278,"doesnt look like weeping but i do love the compost, color and light.maybe blue would be better."
s176aj61de,4279,"a good picture, a little blur, but still good"
s176aj61de,4280,"the photo is a bit blurry, but its a great idea!"
cenpsn97vk,4281,rofl . interesting feel here. it looks cartoony almost. i dig it.
e1ozo9c6je,4282,interesting picture . is the amount of grain intentional?
rdox0ss9rk,4283,nice imagery. colors are great. nice work
8bcbyzy5qv,4284,"i think this wouldve been better if there were more detail in theleft, it seems a little empty without much there."
8bcbyzy5qv,4285,the photo is a bit dark for my taste.

eqa7ck779u,4287,"i nearly went for this line, but felt that my image, as this one, looked too rural to fit into the suburban bit. i like the infrared treatment though."
eqa7ck779u,4288,"i guess im kinda old school, but this just looks way too. artificial for my taste."

o2scuuilwq,4459,"sorry, but i dont like very much those huge white areas without any details."
bun79w7lbk,4460,"i like the colors and patters, but i have no idea what im looking at."
bun79w7lbk,4461,"a bit more contrast, a bit more sharpening and a bit more saturation would really make this pop."

j6xze90805,4527,magic colors in that sky.wow pretty.
xnwpjtviil,4528,they look like theyre all of the same age. way too dark and slightly oversaturated
r86i99mgir,4529,"very unique take on eggs! i like it! might have upped the contrast a little bit, make the browns a little more so, but otherwise its great."
wi1ibsj38k,4530,"in terms of color, this is the winner. but the image is so busy, and the arrangement of the flowers too subtle. in fact, i almost didnt see the not."
47jggrqhm8,4531,good contrast of old and new but picture could be sharper
47jggrqhm8,4532,"the contrast is very strange, a lot of detail has clearly been lost."
47jggrqhm8,4533,"personally this is hard to look at on my screen, the blue throws it off, but i like the idea"
47jggrqhm8,4534,pity about the absence of contrast
mrjkj4ykhv,4535,"nope, dont get it, sorry, not sure what the black stuff is."
vcvysas7h4,4536,great idea and setup. the bottom eggs a bit contrasty though.
48ux5wqljh,4537,"a little dark, and there is a shadow in the front"
48ux5wqljh,4538,"good idea, but i think your execution leaves something to be desired. i think if you had more light, or softer light, wed get to see more of your pens."
v3pzvyuq9m,4539,"feels a little flat, missing contrast and colour maybe."
v3pzvyuq9m,4540,"nice picture, would have been better is pumkin was a bit more orange"
v3pzvyuq9m,4541,"not terribly interesting. colors are kind of dull lightings a bit harsh, flat."
v3pzvyuq9m,4542,"thou i like your example.it lacks in color, kind of dull and flat in tone"
z78p3kucpr,4543,"sorry dont like the picture grain, but it is a nice picture"
z78p3kucpr,4544,way too much noise for my taste.
zjxa2hmam4,4545,"but, imo only, the white balance does look off. the image itself gives a yellowish hue to it. white balance with the light you use, not before."
rcjbxcd296,4546,"nice capture. feel it could do with a little more sharpening, and perhaps a little more contrast, imho. ."
2og8h8s9u6,4547,"that thing looks crazy. good job on the exposure, and the trailing lights."
1bh8qrm4wy,4548,"nice feeling image, great bw"
2b2obz4fim,4549,"wow, this is a very nice photo. great job on placement, and your colors are very vivid."
4i9rh8are9,4550,the grapes are way too dark making them look more like olives.
stj0v0x0sp,4551,"i get the idea, but theres something kinda forced about this. also, lots of noise."
3h5bs4ezsv,4552,"nice picture and detail, good idea."
tvau7v6qvc,4553,"i like, but mostly because i have a personal preference for orange."
ul1szpavcl,4554,love the colors. i especially like the dead petals on the bottom.
lsc7ohmy1x,4555,so subtle that you dont really notice. im not so sure that black and white was a good pick here.
xdqbu69h0t,4556,"great capture, i wonder how many attempts that took. i love the detail in the drip and the way the drip is still forming and not quite a sphere yet."
sts8wi718e,4557,wonderful use of backlighting. it really bring out the details in the leaves. nicely done.
sts8wi718e,4558,beautiful leaves and fantastic detail. i dont see anything here that i dont like.
liwc018ycn,4559,great colours. i think youve oversharpened a little as you can see by the jagged line on the edge of the scissors.
7mzh1ffjb8,4560,too much color issues good idea
bjcm751mn3,4561,what an amazing color. nice knitwork. the needles are a great accent.
ld3jyhgi1r,4562,nice control on this exposure looks like a tough one.
lhktev2t0r,4563,not exceedingly sharp nor original a good picture nevertheless.
21g1mhknwd,4564,"great comp, nice in bw, ."
lba7xv0ot7,4565,"great idea, nicely composed white balance seems a little off, but perhaps that was deliberate."
lba7xv0ot7,4566,is kind of hard to figure out i mean see i like the idea but maybe if it was more vibrant or less orange
dw75a5dh1u,4567,"i dont know why but i am drawn to this photo. great detail, color. light. i think best in show."
ez3hehg549,4568,"interesting idea. very original, although a bit blurry."
1hbbmbmgka,4569,nice photo. neat handwriting!
1hbbmbmgka,4570,good balance of lights and darks. i wish my handwriting was that good. p
3ua36r3giz,4571,this is a great attempt but its just not as sharp as as id like to see. its also a tad dull.
ih8nrhtgz6,4572,"not keen on the uneven fingernails, but a lovely image ."
t1emfg40c4,4573,nice detail and clarity. a fine photo.
cesna3rpe3,4574,"nice image, the colors and comp are good, but this isnt screaming begin."
0g24zad5sy,4575,"some increased contrast, especially in the shadows could give your image some more clarity. auto levels works well with this one."
wzny6qi8t6,4576,"nice mood, colour treatment."
77che44yze,4577,"nice yellow and red, but maybe a bit too much red. seems over sat."
346nmj2n2x,4578,am lost in this by balance proportionately off somehow. other wise love subjects setting.
o57uvt3cf9,4579,good pp and fantastic mood. love the moving person
o57uvt3cf9,4580,i like the color choices and the contrast. id like to see a version without the person.
op0798yu9v,4581,ah. i love black and white photographs. this one has amazing contrast.
vvodokatq9,4582,vry nice colors and contrast. makes me want to sit a spell on this cold winter day.
haweoo039e,4583,nice tones and pov. works well in bw.
65xenrryzw,4584,"interesting capture. ijust think its just a bit heavy on the processing, maybe oversharpened"
k35evgpy7u,4585,"the image is a little bright, or maybe that was your intention."
k94w7uoff5,4586,"i like how dark this is, creates a cool atmosphere. id like to see a version where the red from the benches pops a little more."
wcmrlzgzo8,4587,theres a blue cast over this one that detracts from what must be brilliant red leaves.
gu17qfxv9j,4588,"the blue supports give it a whimsical feeling which i like. good detail, bordering on oversharp."
eq0n6cnmti,4589,"i like the conversion on this, it seems perhaps a tad bright but not so much to ruin my enjoyment of it"
z6jn20it3i,4590,a nice image. great colors and textures
u5yr15zf5c,4591,"a lovely collection of lines and textures. probably too busy for some but i quite like the way they all sorta blend together. this might be fun to try in bw, too."
dgpsxunfk1,4592,yikes! i just dont see how the negative colors add anything here. interesting patterns though.
pazn46r2my,4593,"im sorry. i just dont care for the processing. there is an overwhelming blue tint hdr? that if toned down might add a nice mood, but as is its just too much."
1c2tcqsw8r,4594,you made a good elesction with the duotone
aitday0kxx,4595,nice contrast of the leaves with the grey.
aitday0kxx,4596,that looks like a really time consuming desaturation job
1h818h5vxf,4597,"good portrait. the black and white is good, the benches is just visible but but its presence is realized."
xmsurllkl4,4598,"i so want to love this but something is off. a bit flat? too yellow? not sure, but great shapes."
w062vbsjoj,4599,pretty dark on my calibrated monitor.
3pcjw8miam,4600,"bold, interesting, excellent tonality."
3pcjw8miam,4601,beautiful bw manages to avoid the pitfalls of excessive pp.
5h5u5qwa0m,4602,im not sure bw does anything for this. would like to see color version
z6znfbzt2x,4603,"great image, nice use of light"
0nqddf2bcu,4604,"i wont give a full cc, as i cant discern your intention, but the pose just doesnt work for me here. the lightingprocessing here presents a very dark, or at the very least dramatic, scenario."
0nqddf2bcu,4605,"nice dark tones, great model."
21y6eybcaj,4606,"i thought that was what they were doing too funny nice setting, mountains are beautiful, father and son just look a little soft"
21y6eybcaj,4607,"lol, thats funny. i would have cranked the saturation down a notch though."
58upqtda3t,4608,very nice work i think its look great in bw
58upqtda3t,4609,this is nice. i love the soft effect. josh hartnett look alike. lol.
0g1uqvi3o6,4610,looks like a vacation brochure. nice capture and illumination. it doesnt scream best friends to me but i like it.
0g1uqvi3o6,4611,idea is good but image is not very sharp and detail is lost
wtyqk5k01a,4612,darling. i wish i could see more backgroundcontext. but nice color and capture. well done.
ni4y7uqrgf,4613,"love it. beautiful idea and wonderfully executed. love the bw, love the comp, love the expressions on the faces. excellent job."
ni4y7uqrgf,4614,"not keen on their facial expressions, but i do like the setup, the color, the light and the whole idea!"
c3zm6akqzk,4615,very good exposure. hard with a black and a white one. maybe blackwhite?
42rqmekbhm,4616,great candid! the exposure is perfect and i love the backlighting.
saff11lut2,4617,"this is the kind of image that tugs on my heartstrings. good job, nice use of black and white"
ykl2oxvhgv,4618,"sweet and innocent, the detail is so nice."
z3osl31xga,4619,nice. id personally prefer a black vignetting effect. but i guess the white gives a nice angelic feel to it
sxu46ar09d,4620,interesting profiles and nice colors.
yw5l069d7z,4621,"aww how sweet! i love this pictue, what are good idea and it is very sweet! i also like the idea with the black and white"
yw5l069d7z,4622,this is a nice image. i like the way they look as though they are sleeping together so you can see how much they care. i like the way it was done in black and white to. nice work.
o1iwobqy9v,4623,the desaturation gives it a little bit of a creepy feel to me. i think i would have much preferred the natural colors here.
9e6cxfsnzi,4624,cute photo. would have liked to see the dogs in more detail thou. but i know that reducing to k or less can lose finer detail
j5arfb3cjm,4625,i absolutely love the colour tones here and the photo in general is simply beautiful.
9iyi2hgvja,4626,the contrast of light and darkness works really well in your pic
aip6kh4klp,4627,i like soft looks but color is too bluish.
zx1qylx0rx,4628,"beautiful photo, not really seeing the whole best friends vibe, but maybe im missing something."
n3kip0epgf,4629,simply lovely. a litlle underexposed to spots keeps it from the big
n3kip0epgf,4630,wouldve been such a nice picture if it werent for the green overcasts.
gokkp9ocia,4631,very good and cosy light. soft and nice
8w8tj6jgp5,4632,"adorable faces, both of them. i like the use of black and white and the softness of this"
fkclgz8pd6,4633,"sorry, this just doesnt work for me. i couldnt tell anything was bloody since it is in bw."
y7fxy111jc,4634,"very well composed. its a little blurry and it could use some rich darks, but very good anyway."
4xgkjz9r9h,4635,"hmm. cant help but wonder how this photo would have looked as bw. just tested it, and it looked good!"
fd9pa2vg5f,4636,good idea. too overexposed for my taste.
k94a84gt1n,4637,"i like this alot, it is a fresh idea, warm colors. very well done."
6m3qvohx49,4638,image of girls is too dark which is a shame because its a nice photo
hrmcxcvvng,4639,i dont understand the strange color casts on this picture. why are the dogs yellow and green? they are also overexposed.
hrmcxcvvng,4640,"colors are off on this, too much yellow maybe? very strange effect"
1ij3q8bj16,4641,good image of action nice clean lines and detail good
f3bzjfwyvn,4642,"love the idea, and the black and white. darling friends image."
cuug2qctfx,4643,what a stunning capture! the details are great and i love the blur you got in the wings.
cuug2qctfx,4644,"great macro, and good job capturing the feel of constant motion. not really best friends though. sorry."
68ey1wtsie,4645,pretty good image i like how close you got to the birds and the detail of it
rhm63l26er,4646,gorgess picture! love the black and white. what beautiful children!
rhm63l26er,4647,"aww very cute, i like the way you used black and white. but a very good idea for friendhsip. this is soo cute!"
418nztl29h,4648,nice use of bw. the two different charakters of the girls are interesting
418nztl29h,4649,very cute picture! i like the idea of black and white for this picture. good job with your placement.
418nztl29h,4650,"this was taken very nicely, its very sharp! the little girls look so cute. i aslo like the way it was taken in black and white. it looks great!"
firobtw41d,4651,another highly impressive image and in wonderful sepia.
pgv9ht9qo4,4652,very sweet. i would like to see more backgroundcontext. nice color and contrast.
0tb9bsziaz,4653,"i am gathering you are referring to your friendship with god, and used the comm to relate that association. it is kind of blurry."
fr21n50vcv,4654,"good idea, poor quality in the image"
epfi57tumb,4655,image is a bit dark. funny.
ofz3bzesea,4656,photo is a bit soft imho.
vvxhuyt2ff,4657,"i like the noise in the picture . a little more contrast would be welcome too, making it more like an old bw photo."
ki3m42jvld,4658,a bit to much contrast but very colorful and neat.
ki3m42jvld,4659,the light seems a little harsh and possibly too much saturation combined with too much sharpness.
zknmer5qtw,4660,good study and choice of tone.
oru0lejwl9,4661,"spooky, dark, grainy, manipulated. and then there is the picture. well, i guess it has all those qualities as well."
hjeyn941lw,4662,"this is a nice picture. i really like the soft colors so you can see the relaxation and peacfulness in the image. nice work,"
hjeyn941lw,4663,this picture is so sweet! i love the coloring of the picture and the way the light lays in. this was a very good idea for a friendhsip photo. and very sweet!
9gxhis3u8d,4664,blurry but it has that vintage look to it.
9gxhis3u8d,4665,it seems as if the image is nothing but a blur
f8egq4ibgc,4666,i love the mood of this picture and how it captures innocent an boyhood in many ways. this trusting lad seems to have a bit of selfpride as well as a good friend.
f8egq4ibgc,4667,your use of color is superb. cant get over your work.
f8egq4ibgc,4668,i love the colours! could have been sharper and more detailed tho.
pywv3kj04t,4669,very cool capture but looks kike they were too fast for your exposure time littlebit unsharp
149tomfqud,4670,beautiful! wonderful tones and warmth here great job
149tomfqud,4671,"superlative exposure control. this cant be ole skiffman, can it?"
c9sgjxnjwr,4672,"nice colors, sensuous curves, and red"

k0jswq1978,4678,nice grainy portrait. lovely textures.

9lr1v4t5k2,4685,"this is so soft with wonderful colour, great job."
3bfdswu0wa,4686,"como conservatory, no? been there a few times myself. the colors seem a bit different than i remember, though."
3myg2f56dt,4687,"this image is neat, just not everyones taste. i dont really know what to say that could help since youve most likely intended for it to turn out this way."
azl582s4d7,4688,james dean immediately came to mind. great use of sepia.
ivzshk1ocf,4689,"great, love it. the way the light works makes this so dynamic. very cool bw."
7oix8qb5gt,4690,i love the saturation of the colors really makes the picture pop!
7oix8qb5gt,4691,wow! stunner! great colours and soft treatment
7oix8qb5gt,4692,"beautiful colors. the clouds seem a little overblown, but still a great pic."
uaosyf5swd,4693,very good and sharp image with lovely colours.

eis5qk2498,4698,pitty you couldnt enter this one in yellow. nice photo.
ef8i0sth0d,4699,i like the dark wintery mood with good control of the highlights here.
mmrbf37krs,4700,"i like this photo. with advanced editing, i wish that you had removed the sign and its shadow."
mmrbf37krs,4701,"shame about the big white sign, otherwise good picture."
7euzj8rql1,4702,"all in all, this is a very unique and memorable image. good job."
23d5ofgb04,4703,"artistic, gorgeous colors, great use of light!"
p8gb7fxtap,4704,nice exposure. the white looks soo white. mine is usually grey or blue
53bwq1akoi,4705,looks like youve overdone the neatimage here. with better postprocessing this would be a really nice picture.
53bwq1akoi,4706,"looks like a lot of neatimage, or whatever you use to reduce noise."
53bwq1akoi,4707,"one thing that goes against this picture is that its severly oversharpened, it does not have a natural feeling to it."
53bwq1akoi,4708,this looks intensely over neat imaged.too unnatural
29jv9qxg9b,4709,nice comp. id prefer a less orange sepia though.
ictibufzri,4710,"great candid, i really liked it. maybe bw or sepia would look better, but im not sure if thats something youd like."
pgn4z57jm9,4711,prefer to see it in color or black and white great comp lots of noise
pgn4z57jm9,4712,"technical , roses are a bit too blurred and too much graininess"
27ta87umtm,4713,excellent win. i am really glad this got the blue

qu4m3n3y66,4716,really good mood in this photo. be interested to see what it was like in bw.
qwdw3nftro,4717,good clean sharp image but would like to see the happy couples faces.
qwdw3nftro,4718,"the white is a little bit blown out on my computer, but maybe my setting are just on the fritz"
88zwabtifb,4719,bit too soft for my taste but nice compasition.
88zwabtifb,4720,love the softness and comp. i also like the somewhat highkey look. nice job.
xzb30i47mh,4721,yout monarch needs a tad more contrast to bring out the black and orange better
spd5xhkin5,4722,"wow, such a powerful photography. really, really astonishing. love the dark tones."
bi810b8xl8,4723,nice textures but maybe a little too much contrast?
vc17og42qw,4724,"such an awesome moody pic, great use of bw"
vc17og42qw,4725,nice quiet mood to this one. good choice to use bw.
vc17og42qw,4726,"beautiful in bw, nice work"

hp4yi96hzm,4728,shes so cute! great quality image! love the colors!
yjgij7ou15,4729,"as for the photo, its technically ok, well exposed in most areas is a little soft to be honest but that is only minimal."
23jb8de4jw,4730,very sharp drops and clean image.
jz8nnwu2kx,4731,"pretty, but seems a tad soft. the borders are overkill in my opinion."
jz8nnwu2kx,4732,i like this one better if it were in black and white. outstanding photo nonetheless.
txg327q45m,4733,"good pp, i like the grain. nice copositon with a feeling."
b1nptdk3it,4734,"nice patroitic image, i like the choice of bw"
b1nptdk3it,4735,im not sure whethet bw is the best choise here. however the image has power but i feel a little more contrast would really lift this
j9pks33mlk,4736,too much saturated colors for a nature picture.
y09vzx363o,4737,interesting contrast in archtectural styles.
frcvphpjio,4738,need to adjust the white balance. there is a green color cast.
x911x0oy8p,4739,"wow, love this one. great clouds light."
dmrxc5rnw0,4740,"pure quality, excellent, superb, need i say more."
v5avh0d1s3,4741,the sharpness is remarkablegreat job
eski2c7cz9,4742,i feel theres a heavy green cast to this image. play with levels or the color balance a bit to see if you can correct it.
b97sbp163x,4743,powerful image. like the fact the image demonstrates the noncaring nature in most of use with the blur of motion as they ignore the gentlemen.
b97sbp163x,4744,nice use of selective color. sad image.
9nfkghwyra,4745,"awesome capture, though i do detect a little motion blur."
mnbyw464h3,4746,great color. the contrast of yellow and blue works great.
mnbyw464h3,4747,this is an absolute splash of color! exquisite.
ludahhuuko,4748,"wow the colors, and contrast you have capturedacheived are wonderful, i feel like i am there just in mood and feeling."
ludahhuuko,4749,"its moody whilst using bright tones, which is unusual"
ludahhuuko,4750,"really interesting. i like the intense, surreal saturation of the colors."
ludahhuuko,4751,i really like the light and the colour changes in the image.
ludahhuuko,4752,grunge. i like the wacky colors and textures.
amk6xiw3jk,4753,beautiful colors. i really like the subtle light on the rocks.
amk6xiw3jk,4754,nicely expressed in the orange glow of the late evening .early morning? light.
1yxz4mps8a,4755,very cool patterns and great colour but doesnt look very sharp.
r8k8c42udn,4756,aw would be perfect in bw with all those tones and textures.
62l27298im,4757,nicely composed image. great tone and sharpness.
62l27298im,4758,"ahh, he looks really familiar think ive been to a ren faire where he performs. nice capture. wish this was in motion, though!"
sq60nmol01,4759,the colors are excellent. the picture is interesting and makes me want to know more about it. i hope you have described it in your details section.
5wik7w9g8i,4760,"beautiful capture, sharp details excellent work."
5wik7w9g8i,4761,"nicely timed and composed photograph, with good detail in the feathers and not oversaturated."
rh1mvw8i2o,4762,"no argument with your technique, but id be curious to see the original to see howhow much the motion blur added. ive tried using that filter myself, but only found it effective applied very sparingly."
rh1mvw8i2o,4763,"well, this one stopped me cold and i had to check to make sure i wasnt moving. outstanding job.espcecialy the neat frame.tenarooni"
225fvxyyv1,4764,whoa. neat use of saturation. i really like the surreal feel of it. great job!
225fvxyyv1,4765,"the colors dont look real, too exaggerated. too much ps perhaps?"
225fvxyyv1,4766,"i suspect others may come down on this for the technicolor processing, but i like it a lot. freaking bizarre, makes me thing mystery magic."
6z9mmhze2w,4767,"nice soft portrait, did you use a filter for that soft light effect? i like it, its almost as though she were softly glowing."
9cl3te2don,4768,shame the person is in such a deep shadow. he seems deep asleep as well.
gutbboqvub,4769,"wow! the tones here are amazing they create mood throughout the photo, love the stopped motion too!"
gutbboqvub,4770,nice power shown here. seems a tad dark though.
gutbboqvub,4771,excellent timing on this photograph. good choice to have it in bw.
gutbboqvub,4772,the tonality reminds me very much of an ansel adams photo. great job.
gutbboqvub,4773,i love the graininess and downtempo tonalities of this. beautiful rendering of highlights.
9gds2cfmva,4774,"the siimplicity of this photo is excellent. i gave this a , but i think it would benefit from a slight contrast push also. great work"
v1hzhq88m6,4775,"the green is an interesting idea, but the noisecompression artifacts kinda kills it"
v1hzhq88m6,4776,"this would have been a very nice picture if it wasnt for the oversaturation, it made the clouds green."
uumdgr18xz,4777,"id do alot more walking if i had a walk that beautiful to walk on its a beautiful picture, with amazing colors!"
6g9f9dee1t,4778,"excellente, very nice work, love your choice of bw"

zam84r9fv5,4781,"nicely composed image. your postshot editing gives it a warm, almost surreal feel."
ipp7mo69jb,4782,cool.im curios to know how that would look in black and white with minor adjustments. spookey atmosphere.
84r1elqbim,4783,"looks of detail captured here. has a bit of a red tint, may be better in bw."
648bid9vi0,4784,"a warm, sweet image that grabs your heart. i like it!"
z6oymfaa32,4785,"nice contrasts of texture, tone, and tension."
t8gx02h0ug,4786,"nice image, but too harsh on the contrast. i think this would have made an excellent black and white image."
556hvzp3og,4787,"i think this is very nice. the blurred reflections look very cool combined with the sharp leaves, which creates a great effect."
y3mxji5dmy,4788,immensely powerful. might benefit from a slight slight bump in contrast in the dark areas.
y3mxji5dmy,4789,dramatic use of light and bw!
9i76oaqh7d,4790,"this picture is awsome, i love the different levels of colour."

2tth6kp753,4792,"works well in bw, you used leading lines well, nice details, excellent"
wrwgixbax1,4793,i think that a little bit of powered down fillflash might have worked even better than just the light from the torches.
75gyqjsv4n,4794,"very nicely captured image, without over doing the sharpening and saturation."
75gyqjsv4n,4795,fantastic macro. what really makes this photo amazing is the contrast in colors. wow.
hnof3kfsq8,4796,"i really like this one. the cloud colors and formations are excellent. so far, this is my first . nice job!"
tmzvxcmsh4,4797,in as much that this is a picture of a picture it could be done better with a little contrast.
8jd9fyz0oj,4798,"wow i love the colour, ive only ever seen yellow ones in the uk."
8jd9fyz0oj,4799,sort of uninteresting to me. the pumpking is also more red than it is orange.on my monitor anyway.
3xkc1nmgj1,4800,the clouds and colors are very dramatic. wish there was some detail in the fg. this appears to be quite oversharpened.

3xkc1nmgj1,4802,those are some mighty interesting clouds.nice capture. the colors are nice too.
3xkc1nmgj1,4803,"cool cloud formation, but the photo is oversharpened"
3xkc1nmgj1,4804,"i like the idea and the colors, but the clouds looks a little too fake and overprocessed to me. the haloing from oversharpening doesnt add to the image either."
udw36nkh1l,4805,"i recognize this photo, loved it then, love it now, but as i remember the other version had a different tonality more cyan blue and a different frame.honestly. i prefer the earlier version"

jr4dmj6bau,4820,beautiful colors and textures. wonderful clarity.
rrwnwscj3x,4821,just a tad too dark to my liking. a little more light could have worked wonders here.
rrwnwscj3x,4822,"love the colors, especially the little patches of orange against the blue. well done."
gf2vb4vbb1,4823,"wonderful. could have even gone with less green and more blue in my mind, but thats not a criticism. just an opinion."
qlvevi9xng,4824,wonderful use of available light has created an awesome picture.
uiifc40x7g,4825,interesting effect with the tiny bit of color a nice soft evocative portrait of a special time.
uiifc40x7g,4826,interesting choice on the selective desat. it makes the photo very unique. good job!
1pkutcaw9i,4827,really lovely. i like how the light falls. i would so love to see this with a good black and white processing im really surprised you didnt go with that anyway the tones seem great for it. bumping one.
1pkutcaw9i,4828,"very well taken, nice pose, model, and quality. just seems to not have any highlights or much contrast. a tiny bump of highlights would do wonders i feel. as is a"
1pkutcaw9i,4829,liz taylor jumps into mind . classic portrait i love it
6n1acuq3e4,4830,i generally dont like the use of selective desatuation but you have used it well here. it very nicely helps to establish the mood of the picture. well done.

svkor4q2ai,4839,"this is incredible. i hate landscapes but i would sell my mother for this. why this is so good is completely mysterious to me, and i like it that way."
svkor4q2ai,4840,"wow. very impressive, love the light and the drama. the tones are excellent though i wish i could see just a little more detail and separation in the darker hills. ."
svkor4q2ai,4841,terrific figureground ambiguity gives an air of mystery to this fine bw image.
hwebyd4hty,4842,the painterly quality to this image makes it extra special. hope you do well.
sp1uqwgy1z,4843,sweet sweet sweet picture little bit too much light from underneath but still a wonderful idea.
zt3fd7ub6i,4844,this is cool! excellent light and atmosphere!
h32rdyuxtt,4845,"a bit grainy, but i guess its okay"
h32rdyuxtt,4846,great texture in this one. very good use of black and white.
csc5pa52yc,4847,"very nicely captured image, without over doing the sharpening and saturation. still hard to believe it is a photograph in as many times as ive seen it or varioations of it."
36596lmcur,4848,lovely flowerin my opinion the shadow on most of it doesnt do it justice.
o0ze9iwykz,4849,neat. was this building designed purposely to get this effect or just a happening? bol
x1m70j1t9s,4850,"maybe too much shadowhighlight tool? with the black in this image, id bet some levels work would really make this image pop!"
d8iz1rs2rg,4851,"a bit too dark on the newt, details lost"

g87dhb9qp2,4858,"i like this one a lot, especially the monochrome effect. quite the powerful image."
uved097cvf,4859,too dark to create the mood! the pic has a lot of potential
gmhev9ums6,4860,"technical , not fond of sepia for this pic bw woulda been cool though"
rcki1iqwgf,4861,an excellent dark and moody picture.
rcki1iqwgf,4862,it represents a gloomy vision of the industrial age.
rcki1iqwgf,4863,i know this one amazing light captured here. beautiful photography.
4aslnofsg4,4864,fantastic capture. imho slightly over sharpened. still here. curious why did you not go for a complete black and white presentation?

u6bc8bt6wh,4869,"this is a nice photo. great idea, and it came out pretty well. there is something weird about the colour though the nonreflection birds look odd in some way."

9c7a7jmpeg,4892,"uh, is that the black lagoon there? nice spooky look."
9c7a7jmpeg,4893,a little too dark and busy for me with the blurred plants in the fg.
i08ypjrx8l,4894,the perfect sepia tone and bags of detail.
i08ypjrx8l,4895,i love the detail and stillness of this photo good job!
dl17wqddxy,4896,bw was a good choice for these oldstyle racers.

e8xap0n28k,4901,ill have to mark this one as an instant classic.very nice! i dont know if the mood or the texture wins me over more.
e8xap0n28k,4902,"im also inerested in the noise in your image. it looks really good, id love to know how you created it. ."
e8xap0n28k,4903,"seems like an excessive use of noise. a winter walk in my mind would convey cold blue tones, not greens."
e8xap0n28k,4904,"nice vibe indeed love the watery, grainy feel. i would have dropped the saturation a little more though to cool it down further and add more gravitas."
e8xap0n28k,4905,"wonderful photo, maybe a bit too grainy for my taste, but with interesting tone and full of relaxing atmosphere. well done!"

hwwz4061oj,4909,btw nice use of parcail desat.
hwwz4061oj,4910,this is rather poor attempt to make a ghost or whatever you were trying. very uninteresting image.
hwwz4061oj,4911,the ghost of paris hilton.still shopping.
hwwz4061oj,4912,very nice transit of motion i like the motion blur as well.
z1otkbktnp,4913,a bit much blue color cast.

ukn6r7uzoh,4920,"great caputre, but a bit of over exposure here and there. still a nice big for you!"
ukn6r7uzoh,4921,"this is screaming for an adjustment of curves. it would enrich the picture like you cant believe. then increase the contrast. i just did it in photoshop and it looked cool as it is, it seems so washed out. bummer, cause i like the idea."
0z95ti71s0,4922,"many differant tones here, in this fine example of a bw image."
v26ny8lzte,4923,"wow. great colors. glad im not there, i hate the cold. beautiful job."

jy0uk7etzm,4927,beautiful color on the cloudfog tops
qrf6v9h3gk,4928,nice lines and light play here. would probably look much better as a larger photo.
qrf6v9h3gk,4929,wow look at that texture. very unique.
yew2sdq3r0,4930,"the softness in this image, is what appeals to me."
vmzudqebij,4931,nice image but too yellow for my liking.
vmzudqebij,4932,"nice photo, however im not at all keen on the bright yellow tinting you gave it."
vmzudqebij,4933,"hmm. i like the image but not the tone, maybe a traditional sepia would have been better, and a little grundge and contrast would make it look like an old print."
nca4ns1duw,4934,beautiful tonalities in this bw.
foe1rcayyr,4935,he looks like stephen speilberg. nice colors.
nkz0k0kgrk,4936,good picture too. though i would have liked to see brighter whites and more detail in the branches
kpawcgrfv3,4937,lush greens.lots of detail
ugjbo2r5ax,4938,if it was not for the lights on the building this image almost looks like it was taken along time ago. not sure about this being bw. i sure what you may have wanted was old type photo look here. the content does not jump out to me. i would mess with this image. i would try cloning out the lights then tring a dueltone or sepia look. just for fun of course.
ugjbo2r5ax,4939,"wow, i love the felling of desolation. great cold atmosphere. nice contrast."
ltmys6rvus,4940,the grey tones look a bit washed out. i think this needs more contrast to emphasize the decay. .
ltmys6rvus,4941,very effective use of black white. nice.

kf4cawxafx,4944,nice closeup.black and white was a nice choice. good tones and texture.
kf4cawxafx,4945,wow what sadness or maybe thats my interpretation. excellent color choice.
lu4ic8f6f8,4946,i really do like this a lot. the contrast between the bright blue and the dark browns is really effective.
gn4zfqjbnd,4947,good wavey shadowlight contrast. very effective
78wabxcn90,4948,wow this amazing! what a capture. i am really curious to see where it was taken. i love the movement in this piece.

f8ibtsr0aw,4956,"nice office, can i have one like that. nice sharp pic."
f8ibtsr0aw,4957,"not bad at all, nicely exposed, a little too saturated for my taste but nothing that bothers me. however, for me, its just average so i gave it a . it just lacks some action something to make it go pop, its a bit static. of course i am comparing this to formula images i see in the papers and maybe that is a little bit harsh."
f8ibtsr0aw,4958,awesome colors nice and sharp too good job.
698z2fa9qz,4959,"nice take on a seascape, normally dont see the brown in these types of shots. i like it."
bnk3dyy5fi,4960,i personally dont like the use of selective desaturation in this instance. an interesting capture.
qxrsx87dcd,4961,"just my personal taste, i guess, but i feel this is way overprocessed."
qxrsx87dcd,4962,i like the dark tratment to this and the splash of color. well done.
2itn3yc9j2,4963,"i really like the blue, id like to see more of that and the glasses and less of the dark areas all around the photo."
2itn3yc9j2,4964,yummy i am waiting. nice use of light to bring the blue into the martini glasses themselves.
hs8ru1mx6t,4965,awsome capture. color is awesome and technicals are dead on!

mwjbgoobdd,4984,very nice black and white. i hope to do work as good as this one day.

xsj5ctqi7t,4997,"good detail. just my preference, i would boost the highlightsmidtones just a bit."
xsj5ctqi7t,4998,this is a great pic but way too dark.
xsj5ctqi7t,4999,maybe a brighter image and increased contrast
5nf613pwjx,5000,"nice, but would just be soo much nicer if the clouds would have some texture. from me."
j04s3lu0d7,5001,very colorful like the contrast of the birds color against the brown.

9qywi1tz4f,5023,nice black and white. great light and shadow play.
9qywi1tz4f,5024,"excellent bw work. i think usm very lightly would perfect this, as i think its currently slightly soft."
9qywi1tz4f,5025,this is a great black and white. i think it would be very nice with some grain texture as well.
9qywi1tz4f,5026,very moody image.kind of gives me a feeling of impending doom.stunning clouds and great detail on the buildings.
9qywi1tz4f,5027,"great bw, good dodge an burn job"
tccmmksi3x,5028,"nice slow shuder speed and great color, and cleen deatal im just not sold on the compasisition.gave you a"

iry2vqyxz8,5033,"cute and personal photo! i this would really look great brighter, and with maybe a soft glow or something?"
kf290b7xxc,5034,i like the use of light and shadows. the photo is very leading without showing very much.
kf290b7xxc,5035,great mood and light to this beautifully done portrait
55q29xrm5o,5036,"beautiful portrait maybe a bit bright which is why i have gave it a , regards stu"
st98hclq2l,5037,thats some really interesting coloring. weird things going on with the sharpnessfocus though.
hy0pucn6eo,5038,"i like the muted colours, although this is perhaps a little too soft for my tastes. did it lose a little sharpness in downsizing?"
39cxazfi1a,5039,your blacks look washed out use levels or curves to make the black tones even darker. .
39cxazfi1a,5040,it seems that the blacks are a bit soft too. curves? auto contrast?
8gxsfk2jrn,5041,great social commentary! nice colors.
f7zfvdar8l,5042,i like the black and white. it seems to really show the harshness of the life that these dogs live. great job!
j4d8p7qpvd,5043,wow. thats pretty cool. excellent detail. definitely havent seen one of these before.
b2o7fef2p8,5044,"hahaha, great idea, seems a litte bit bright though"
z7077hkapu,5045,great place but the colours seems a little flat. perhaps another time of day?
z7077hkapu,5046,this is great in color and would be very dynamic in bw also.i dont know i think it might have been better in bw
p3qga2iplt,5047,i like th esolitude of this and the contrasty effect.
k0iglxzh8g,5048,last christmas? is he sick? is he dieing? he does look a little pale. hmm. now im really thinking about it.
1t1ont3by6,5049,how beautiful and thoughtful. color is marvelous. thought provoking.
1t1ont3by6,5050,"good work, what filter did you use for the light flare?"
1t1ont3by6,5051,this is a thinking picture. very provocative and well balanced. nice job.
1t1ont3by6,5052,"wonderful mood and beautiful light, great artistic presentation"
f8azm8q5m9,5053,this is a fantastic photo. everything from the bw work to the dreamy feel work really well together.
f8azm8q5m9,5054,nice exposure doesnt look like it was overexposed so no need to pp the heck out of it. very pretty
hptbmd3stc,5055,amazingly sharp and detailed. i think the dark opening distracts from it a bit though
hptbmd3stc,5056,super sharp detail! how did you get such a metallic look?
hptbmd3stc,5057,the detail on this is so amazing that it almost doesnt look real.
9nqecf4szd,5058,this would be a perfect photo to increase the contrast and saturation on. in my opinion it is just screaming out to be more vibrant!
p6nzc26zxq,5059,nice capture! i would have liked it a little sharper. but very cool!
uteu9bf5xe,5060,a beautiful image full of vibrant color and movement

mkw2jniz3j,5068,excellent ncapture. the colors and tones are amazing. a real beauty. well done.
7ugc2a00zp,5069,very nice colors and play of light and shadow. good job!
pxoi973p0t,5070,great use of light and an excellent portrait.
pxoi973p0t,5071,i think you might have desaturated the teeth a bit you have clumps of grey. a trick i use and you might have even used it! is to desauturate only the yellow hues. i remember seeing this before still think its a remarkable portrait!
pxoi973p0t,5072,"ive seen some versions of this pic before. liked it then, like it now! fun picture! one criticism would be that the teeth are looking a little blue, but thats about it."
p4m34r6lob,5073,really hard to to make out the detail when the image is so small.if u made it bigger the impact would improve!
wxve2p7ytj,5074,very nice tones and good use of exposure here. i like the atmosphere very much.
wxve2p7ytj,5075,wonderful mood and blue cast!
4su7bduuhl,5076,"the picture is greate, quality very good, nice comp, good symitry"
4su7bduuhl,5077,intriguing image.excellent detail on the buildings without having the lights burn out.was this a double exposure?
ddxld2hoe3,5078,uhh spooky place. i wonder if its all natural colors.
ddxld2hoe3,5079,those trees are awesome. great use of colors
92ff1h6u0n,5080,"wonderful, but perhaps just a tad oversharpened. i can see a trace of white haloes around the birds."
92ff1h6u0n,5081,"a little obvious on the dodging, maybe lighten the whole pic instead?"
lez9lk1lzj,5082,"nice model and pose, but the image is overprocessed and blown out for my taste"
fv6s0735k6,5083,"dang, great, uh, study! the desat really works."
fv6s0735k6,5084,"i think this photo is quite amazing, the contrast is fantasitc, i love it"
fv6s0735k6,5085,i have always found this photo fascinating. good use of selective desat and leaves a lot to the imagination.

2qcjs2qd25,5087,i love it. so unique. so interesting. youve captured something really artistic here. its beautiful!
2qcjs2qd25,5088,"this is fabulous, ricj and silky and mysterious. pefect tonalities. probably too austere to do really well, but you have my help"

bzfbn9j4jv,5090,out of this world. nice balance. pure.

xvftc9lopz,5094,"ooh. niced. sharp, nice texture and feel and the colour is dreamy whoops sound a bit girly there. dont normally like this kind of thing but"

xc1rr1v1sq,5096,"an amazing portrait, the detail is great, bet he could tell some stories."
xc1rr1v1sq,5097,incredible. love the texture and detail. good choice of tone.
rfd1u19fom,5098,it looks like they are on the run. good capture of movement.
bs4v6wfxex,5099,speechless. this is a stunning contrast of dark light.
bs4v6wfxex,5100,great character and great contrast
gsuakabome,5101,a fine image of a beautiful woman.not quite hangonthewall portrait quality though.
mnmc43sc7f,5102,awesome capture! great colors and quality good job
wmjettcuii,5103,nice image but this smacks of excessie editing to me too much of the detail in the corners has been sacrifaced for the sake of the gimmicky effect
zfstotxgun,5104,"wow! beautiful, the colors are amazing and so is the detail"
zfstotxgun,5105,"nice sharp photo, but seems a little underexposed. i feel there should be some brighter areas to balance it out."
zfstotxgun,5106,"great detail, and i love the soft yet vivid and flowing colors. nice job"
eglvjmyzcb,5107,"i love good macro shots, and this is a very good one.wonderful textures and color."
eglvjmyzcb,5108,really nice light and color.this is actually quite pretty.
eglvjmyzcb,5109,"beautiful light, clarity, and saturation of colors!"
ryhyjmu670,5110,this is nicely done but perhaps a bit too serene for me. it seems kind of static. i like the colors.
dna5tb66f4,5111,love this picture and the colors nice treatment.
dna5tb66f4,5112,oh yeah. . .you know what a duotone is! this is wonderful!
dna5tb66f4,5113,killer duotone. i love that cold glow
dna5tb66f4,5114,what a superb image. love the duotone. suits it perfectly.
38171y2f4c,5115,needs more detail of the flowers and brighter color.
7uaswdzgxl,5116,"lacks contrast, and slightly oversaturated, but a nice candid capture."
7uaswdzgxl,5117,not real fond of the colors displayed here. i like the capture alot.
wsp72fmhr5,5118,very pretty macro nice colors and real sharp ends there
ymmamvreok,5119,the grey tones are overly dominant here some editing on contrast may have helped
cnlojcrghr,5120,very cute.good work with overexposure.
ddtygrtpwc,5121,"ah yes, i see you are once again making use of your most willing model. great color work."
ddtygrtpwc,5122,lots of dodging and burning? nice idea and the image has potential not sure i like the selective desaturation.
ddtygrtpwc,5123,"wow, the colour pop, and the light is great, nice job with the tones."
ddtygrtpwc,5124,"wonderful! a dark dorothy returns from oz, to find kansas a lonely and bitter place."

ax6gczobrq,5126,"great timing, sharp image, good photo."
vckduqf4oj,5127,very interesting still life. i like the color impact of the flowers and the life preserver.
qhfk17x6y8,5128,"really nice, colors and textures have the wow factor"
qhfk17x6y8,5129,a very nice image but it looks a bit oversharpened this would look nice in soft mode
e4vojj1dz6,5130,i like dark shots but this one is just too dark for my taste to rate fairly. sorry.
wcl8d60ya8,5131,"very nice, good timing! nice bright colors"
92qnsqrwu0,5132,highlights are a little too bright in this one. still a very cool image though.
uzgeq4xivd,5133,amazing color and use of available light.
5kya71d7pv,5134,"to me it seems a bit too busy, and slightly soft. maybe usm would fix that? i think sepia may make it less busylooking too."
73c6z5fn8e,5135,a bit of a cyan cast in the whites here. a little work with color balance would help.
73c6z5fn8e,5136,i think the white balance was slightly off as there seems to be a blue cast over the whole photo.
x8wz4j2ks3,5137,"excellent color, however, it looks heavy on the noise reduction. there is a significant loss of detail."
x8wz4j2ks3,5138,i think the overuse of neatimage here has got rid of lots of detail in the feathers which is a shame.
x6i1fwwz5w,5139,cute! nice color and lines.

s067dbyvnz,5148,i really dont care for infrared processing i wonder what this would have looked like in normal colors

s067dbyvnz,5150,lovely image. great fantasy colors.
s067dbyvnz,5151,awesome ir look and wonderful color.

zgqzlmgapn,5158,aww really cute photo! the colours seem slightly washed out but a tiny increase in contrast in pp would help that no problemo.
zgqzlmgapn,5159,"hahaha. funny photo. needs a little more contrast to it though. not so much in the light areas, but could use slightly darker darks in the edging."

28bj91no0i,5165,"good creativity. lacking some sharpness, and the bw conversion seems a little flat."

ed3eoaqiq4,5167,"fantastic photo, love the pastel colours, technically sound."

zsr0sfsxf0,5206,interesting choice of desat. i like that you kept the colors muted. the bit of noise adds to this image.
zsr0sfsxf0,5207,"this is a delightful portrait. im not sure, though, that the selective desat adds to its appeal. still, its definitely very well done."
50zd2tsljr,5208,quaint little character.i love the colors.

66gv81m9ft,5213,i love these colors and the processing great job
7mduci5h8u,5214,i like the motion blur on the person. i think it would be even more effective if everyone was blurred.
pmmqf6s0qi,5215,beautiful colour and picture. good job!
gh32mgoiqr,5216,looks like you did a selective desaturation with this. definatly makes the blue and yellow stand out though.
gh32mgoiqr,5217,"nice, sharp can see the bees hairs, on thirds and leading lines. this meets a definate more than for me. i feel is a little saturate though ."
gh32mgoiqr,5218,selective desat really works well on thisd wonderful image. a

bmfmt8fari,5224,never seen anything like this in cloud formationwonderful and excellent capture and colors.
sh2rgmnbej,5225,too dark in the vignetting for me. otherwise nicely processed with maybe a touch too much smoothing.
sh2rgmnbej,5226,gives me a feeling of cold and warmth at the same time.
sh2rgmnbej,5227,"a little too dark for my taste, but still a very nice picture."
sh2rgmnbej,5228,the thumbnail on this one does not do it justice. a beautiful photo with great colors and contrasts. well done!

3xe3iudsqq,5275,very interesting. sharp and smooth at the same time hard to achieve
aeew39otj9,5276,this is one amazing black and white photograph.added it to my favs!
vj7xcrngzo,5277,beautiful work. nice job with the exposure as well. this is a wonderful capture.
zvnxesuje1,5278,"way off the beaten track, and a really impressive image.looks great."
2aktxpdavt,5279,"beautifully processed pic. i like the grain and the tone, but i cannot figure out what i am looking at."
5n6rp68gaq,5280,great use of shadow here to make a very dynamic image. normally i dont like shots close to midday or durning very bright light. but this one is bright and vivid without washing out. nice!
qhbccf4tie,5281,"what a dreamy, nostalgic mood youve created here. very well done."
qhbccf4tie,5282,"nice, but a little overprocessed i suspect. still going to give an because its quite lovely."
f5yobiwnoh,5283,gorgeous shot.the red is very pleasing.i would prefer it without the photographers however.
3zlx5sqqd1,5284,i love these little guys! great color and bokoh.
2m2ui6j3z2,5285,not real fond of the colors here. i like the capture. beautiful place.
dnfhkajpto,5286,not real sure about the colors here. i like the look and the idea.
rnv2fn0zh4,5287,"adorable little bugger! great colors, wonderful job!"
rnv2fn0zh4,5288,excellent work. great exposure and sharpness. these shots are difficult
8tlo6an6yw,5289,"sweet colors, maybe a bit oversharp here and there"
d5go547kw1,5290,"amazing! colors, contrast, capture. simply beautiful!"
bx7ac0qx1y,5291,"looks slightly over sharpened to me, but i like the leading lines in the show. how did this look in colour?"
oq9ifotlul,5292,"i love it with the hairball. it turns this photo into an instant classic in my mind. unintentional or not, it got a laugh from me, and is still a pretty darned good photo."
oq9ifotlul,5293,"wow, what an impressive growl he has got.orr is it a yawn?"
oq9ifotlul,5294,those are some big death.i wouldnt wanna mess with that tiger.
oq9ifotlul,5295,is that a hairball? lol. excellent capture! vivid colors.
azp5pnhotc,5296,this looks kinda hazy to me only in the darker tone areas uping the contrast would help it alot.
v92dbkzp5z,5297,"i like the sensuality that is present here, however unintended it might have been. the soft look of innocence, but yet.a hint of something else. nice capture, lovely model."
ahnhbejh2e,5298,i think that this would be more effective if the yellow cast was removed and if it was a little larger.
r7qzvdl6qu,5299,"always nice to look at, love the mystery behind such windows and walls."
do5282u7r9,5300,great angles! lovely play of light and shadow! great job!

do5282u7r9,5302,great use of lines and light.
aiytj1edpi,5303,hey i saw a photograph of this building in one of the photo mags. nice job with this image. i love the contrast.
aiytj1edpi,5304,wow theres something you dont see everyday. excellant choice to go bw.
omz227qu20,5305,great caputure timing. the photo looks a bit flat to me. i think this photo would benefit greatly with an increase in contrast.
omz227qu20,5306,to me this photo needs more contrast. it is all quite pale and i think it needs some darker areas to give it more pop.
mdll1q3554,5307,"does look like! well done with this dramatic piece. i do however feel that the sharpening all around and around the edges especially, could have been kept under control for greater impact. its a beauty nonetheless."
mdll1q3554,5308,great photo. this looks perfectly hellish. color treatment is well done.
mdll1q3554,5309,that is pretty cool. great color and atmosphere.
v5a71h4qmk,5310,the motion blur is very effective here but i feel the contrast is a little flat. adding more would have helped i think
5a28h8r5cs,5311,a bit heavy on the colour manipulation here.
5a28h8r5cs,5312,"i like the colours, even though theyre unnatural, but the photo as a whole lacks interest to me, and seems oversharpened a lot."
2rud4tj7gy,5313,i really like the reflections of the masts.good choice to make it black and white. .
fh33oa3j0n,5314,what a beautiful place to be. the colors are excellent. love it!
8vdz5ss2j8,5315,"aahh.this looks so sweet. great colors, great job!"
8vdz5ss2j8,5316,"wow, im curious as to whether this is postprocess color shifts. or if those lizards are naturally so vibrant. either way.great capture!"
780gpctxg7,5317,great tones here. it gives a nice mood to the photo. good job.
b7n66u4to8,5318,"this is a very calming image. i really enjoy the colors, the deep blue is beautiful."
irzfgvrc1z,5319,"nice unique portrait, but seems a little flat to me. try increasing the contrast a bit."
irzfgvrc1z,5320,good picture. a little too gray for my liking. i would love to see more contrast in this picture.
toztchep1w,5321,yellowish color cast is odd. you could have adjusted the color balance somewhat to make the girls faces more natural looking.
5qrz63m3md,5322,very nice.lots of color and great details.
3reukg9bj1,5323,"great orange color, against the purple flowers.very good macro."
ji7iwl6by7,5324,this is adorable! a touch more contrast would really make the colours pop here.
0acnf3ei4m,5325,"would like to see more vibrant colors. im sure the color tones here were intended, i just prefer brighter scens, but thats me. nicely composed"
lx3n9p1ity,5326,i think contrast boosting would create more impact colourwise.
lx3n9p1ity,5327,this is kind of blurry for a macro. good color though.
lx3n9p1ity,5328,"interesting, but needed a little more color boost to really stand it out. and contrast."
lx3n9p1ity,5329,"beautiful colors, great macro. the image really draws you in to look closer."
702154vshc,5330,such interesting creatures these jellies are. nice capture love the red and blue contrast
702154vshc,5331,wow something from the deep blue. this is amazing the movement of the tentacles is prefect.
702154vshc,5332,this picture has alot of potential. if you have ps try adjusting the levels and contrast and see what you get.
p9gpdb8ed2,5333,i love the reflections and the pastel tones that were used here!
5gt8jvx1hx,5334,"looking at this image really put me in a good mood today, like it a lot!"
5gt8jvx1hx,5335,"neat trick, well lit."
8o2w8fi6yn,5336,great capture. i know how hard these are to photograph especially so sharp and with such a breach.
coqlnqlhdh,5337,"great use of color interesting to look at, nicely done"
uil213z55n,5338,"since there are only a few weeks since ive been in paris, i dont remember the skies ever being purple."
uil213z55n,5339,"the colors are way over processed, if you use hue to tone it down a bit closer to blue, just to get rid of the purple, the red and orange colors will look more realistic, and the image will look good."
978ktpwum3,5340,"i love the contrast here, it adds a lot of drama, as does the motion blur."
978ktpwum3,5341,"wow, this is amazing.so fast, so much movement."
978ktpwum3,5342,"great action photo, the bright colors add to the excitement."
978ktpwum3,5343,"howd you get in the pits? way to show the hectic frenzy that takes place there, nice colors."
r7cj1261v9,5344,might have been a bit better if the pilings were true white and less blue.
daxrs444na,5345,nice lightning. think there is nothing that could be improwed for this cink of photograph
8z2geqw8ri,5346,"wonderful colors, wonderful reflections, wonderful image."
xj8tz9uodn,5347,"sharp, wonderful color. i think you did a great job capturing this animals beauty."
xj8tz9uodn,5348,very cool photograph. excellent tone and detail. well done!
55815a9x28,5349,i love the stopped motion. phenominal.
0kqzldz80w,5350,nice bw. interesting motion blur. what are those lines on the fingers?
0kqzldz80w,5351,"it wasnt until after i took a good second look, that i realized what the lines were on the fingers. neat capture!"
0kqzldz80w,5352,i think the picture would appeal to a limited audience. the darkness and blur would also limit the appeal.
0kqzldz80w,5353,interesting capture with nice movement.
0kqzldz80w,5354,"good use of light and dark tones, in this bw image."
32rc2hox0t,5355,you also made a good choice with the reduced saturation. .
32rc2hox0t,5356,"excellent dreamy, mysterious and classy. ."
8kardpp3yl,5357,"very nice, love the sharp white on that musky green."
8kardpp3yl,5358,beautifully captured and well exposed with pleasing blend of color. great job!
jfjc0tzbpi,5359,your colors are nice however and the blueviolet contrasts nicely with the green.
4hzyuihkp2,5360,ok now iam impresed! the stark contrast between white and black is good. from me.
4hzyuihkp2,5361,"how pretty! i love the contrast of the elegant, feminine with the old, dark, rough. she is lovely, and this is a beautiful photo."
x6r00rw1zm,5362,"wow, the green and green is fantastic."
hb8oaxeazs,5363,"colorful, great markings and patterns here."
wnxnv2bmzu,5364,"colors seem a little over worked, on purpose?"
hzs758qick,5365,"lacks a bit of sharpness, but the image in general is very good."
hzs758qick,5366,beautiful reflections. the black and white works here. great job!
fgyfg12ado,5367,"you have chosen the colors very good, a beautfiul macro.very nice"
dujqy25izh,5368,"i think this could have been a real interesting piece if you work the texture, contrast and colours. definitely some potential."
qjxveadeol,5369,a very pristineimage. nice color and clarity.
as22ojtx6n,5370,"i like the blue cast here from the evening light, it really gives the place a nice atmosphere."
as22ojtx6n,5371,youve managed to capture the light associated with these types of days superbly. brilliant work.
6mjigzdi8f,5372,"wow, very sharp color here. beautiful."
ck19hafw64,5373,looks like the suicide squad. how many died in the making of this unique image?
byrmu8j49x,5374,you should have rotated the image counterclockwise to get that light standard straight. nice tones
byrmu8j49x,5375,"great color love the pink hues, the dardks are very drastik but i suspose u didnt want to over expose."
y0c7orx3zl,5376,this is an amazing image! simply beautiful! great use of shadow and light!
y0c7orx3zl,5377,nice photo. great contrast. good job.
w0wdwxzs03,5378,this looks like one of those images that looks different on many monitors but looking closely i can see the mysterious feeling and color here.
juqbpl4odq,5379,"i wish the colors were a tad richer here, but the lightness of the picture gives it that classic look. great job. ."
2smokmba3c,5380,"every time i see this i still cant get over the detail. it just doesnt look real, like a movie prop or something. amazingly well done!"
yywtmrm7c9,5381,i dont care for the silhouettes as much as i think i would have liked to see some of the beautiful detail in these windmills.
qjoxrzh8pb,5382,i like the way you have captured the light through the trees. i would call them magic falls.
ssuu3tmu5p,5383,"color, motion, texture, frailty,"
ssuu3tmu5p,5384,how beautiful and what an interesting detail to capture!
wg7bqdsl93,5385,what a great play of light and shadow. beautiful!

03g0k2rzdi,5392,"looks a little oversharpened to me, with sharpness halos on the spires. nice grab though, very industry meets nature"
03g0k2rzdi,5393,very nice silhouettes with lots of fine detail.
h8dvayqncu,5394,"here ita really not clear what this is a picture of. too close. had it been in colour, maybe it it would have bben clearer."
h8dvayqncu,5395,"im not quite sure what this is. but, if thats how you see yourself, good for you! i like the black and white. the light and shadow are good too!"
o1nyzqymo5,5396,"excellent, def deserves the red if not blue!"
o1nyzqymo5,5397,"tpp much software here,subject is cute but light is terrible."
o1nyzqymo5,5398,"nice detail in the rocks, and great color! congrates"
zwxmp7igbo,5399,wonderful portrait! very nice use of selective desat!

d9vjiksjcd,5410,dark and moody with great details and contrast.
ucud2jmkjk,5411,you oversaturated the colors. the darks are purple. be carefull with saturation.
n21p5pdhmd,5412,"i like the vignetting, but i think it should have been applied evenly to all four corners. its still a great portrait. love the highkey bright white."
n21p5pdhmd,5413,ah.the lazy hazy days of summer.looks like youve caught her in a daydream.really nice light.well done.
34dgz9ol33,5414,alittle too much saturation in my opinion

m78d3bj8lo,5435,nice sharp and detailed feathers.
m78d3bj8lo,5436,needs clarity and sharpness.
nmyvjkcdmg,5437,"i have a feeling as to what youre after here, but think it needs a bit more work. there is nothing automatic about these shotsthey take a lot of effort, and a lot of experimenting. one thing to do is to check your light patterns to make sure all the lines are coming out complimentary, rather than haphazardly. while this is just a bit too brash for me, i appreciate the effort."
14zmq4h59a,5438,nice classic . really cool photo.
x74fm4nhlw,5439,well framed. the splash of purple is a very nice touch and adds that something special.

3t98nycoj5,5442,"a beautiful place, for sure, but im not really sold on the processingit seems uneven and out of balance."
3t98nycoj5,5443,"this appears pixelated perhaps due to over sharpening? and i dont know if its burning or what, but the grey stuff over parts of the clouds and mountains looks terrible."
oandt50nhk,5444,"oh, this is truly lovely. the lights are so warm, and lines inviting."

x7a14wyad2,5452,there is a harsh digital edge around the birds.
ieznt7ggcb,5453,really nice but the trees at the bottom look quite oversharpened. and some of the shadows also look at least on my monitor over postprocessed
ieznt7ggcb,5454,"wow, excellent postprocessing . some will say its overdone but i like it this way"
aubr0goyl7,5455,it is beautiful but too soft for my liking. nice image though.

vzaguewisw,5462,"oh yes great eyes,dof and sharpness"
vzaguewisw,5463,wonderful use of selective desat here. this is really spooky.

rdlx8hu182,5474,"super work, mark! the light is fantastic, and you took good advantage of it!"
rdlx8hu182,5475,"good, but too soft! it looks as if you ran it over with a steamroller, flattening all the detail and reality of the photo"

rdlx8hu182,5477,"beautiful. i love that it has several color groupings. brown, green, blue, white, a hint of pink. lovely."

iqshuvsfpn,5496,great macro and vibrant colors!
iqshuvsfpn,5497,having a bit of a hard time with the colors being so bright and contrasty.
iqshuvsfpn,5498,almost looks like a black light poster of sorts.
792w2ljeaf,5499,"lovely flowers. i like blurry look, but its a bit too much."
ei9dbcav8w,5500,"it is almost magical, great colors and textures."
ei9dbcav8w,5501,"wow, nothing else to say . from me today, im in a good mood."

toh4jdbch6,5505,"nice moody photo, i dig subtle colors ."
2i07qef4w8,5506,"not bad, but this photo should be postprocessed with curves, levels and stuff to bump the contrast and else . and it should be black and white, my opinion only"
lbtzktlrsy,5507,cool dude. i love night shots and i love reflections. i also love the color blue! when you put them all together what do you get? an !
lbtzktlrsy,5508,worst not exactly sharp and image quality if suffering a bit

6wm5cfh78t,5517,"brilliant motion blur, bet that took some tries!"
6wm5cfh78t,5518,groovy. would like to see a contrasty bw version of this could be seriously unnerving
9ycdkcakx6,5519,too many lines ropes. perhaps bw would have worked better?

iubel691gl,5528,too much hue and sat.
iubel691gl,5529,"too much saturation. i know dcp members love it, but it does not look real. saturating a little from the original to give it pop is good, but this is overboard."

j9wnx2eu9f,5531,"this is pretty unique and i like it, but the whites are just a tad blown out. a little more definition would make it pop."
j9wnx2eu9f,5532,"smooth, smooth transitions in this beautiful photograph. blue comes dangerously close to being too much, but thankfully stops just short. excellent work, !"

jbv3humwra,5607,"oh how i wish it was sharper the light and colours are very good, but it lacks som sharpness."
jbv3humwra,5608,a little too much noise reduction. cool idea though
vqydhemwba,5609,nice wooded photo but everything including the trees has a green tint to it?
mrai83bi22,5610,cleanly processed. needs vibrance. photo is too soft for me.

6c443g28mq,5672,great portrait! the only thing about it that bothers me is that you probably went a bit too far with the sharpening tool. i like the highkey approach and the cropcomposition. a bit softer and it wouldve been an
v0ue7ikkbg,5673,"great color, texture, softness and detail all combined into a great photo. well done!"
u2yvy6jv4c,5674,"nice enough, but the processing leaves it feeling somewhat artificial. you might consider trying a bw conversion."

8w9bp0xzja,5700,"not quite sure what to make of this. i love the colors, but there are places where the textures seem strange, as if overlyprocessed for noise reduction. i may be wrong, but thats how it looks to me. an interesting collection of shapes, to say the least."
2w4g6olifs,5701,the texture and detail in this is absolutely stunning! beautiful photography!

qmg9fin168,5703,"nice vintage look , with more grain it would be even better !"
b5z9f2r8xg,5704,"i like the motion of the random passerbys, but not sure the selective desaturation was best for this."
b5z9f2r8xg,5705,i love the motion blur and the selective desat
typgifwswt,5706,"this doesnt do much for me. im sure its a beautiful place, but the exposure just doesnt invite me in. theres just too much stuff that doesnt have enough detail, and the one thing with detail doesnt really do anything. maybe with some more aggressive pp, something could come of this."

uwd6ywomlv,5717,"tate, this is such a beautiful image! the light is amazing on your daughter."
uwd6ywomlv,5718,pretty! a little heavy on the noise reduction.
uwd6ywomlv,5719,"ohhwuh! how incredibly awesome! its a beautiful photo under any circumstances, but the way you have processed it in soft sepia tones enhances it even more! this is a photo that will never grow old! never look outdated, and i cant help but believe it will always be cherished above most all others! fantastic job!"

ori65dziss,5754,i love the coloring. its perfect for the old time feel.

ap841irtjl,5825,this certainly doesnt look like something easy to capture! i like the detail you have just a shame about the noise but that cant be avoided in the conditions i suppose o

0r71zosoov,5841,"wouldve liked to see the colors a little brighter, just my cents though"
0r71zosoov,5842,this picture would probably have been a lot better if you have had adjusted the colour levels to get rid of the grayish feeling in it.

uht9uugfox,6499,nice layering of colors.
wckteajuea,6500,"additionally, the b w conversion could be better. this feels a bit flat and could use a bit of a boost in contrast either via a levels or curves adjustment. to be honest though, and remembering i havent seen the original, but i cant help thinking this may have worked better in colour. this coming from someone who mostly does b w"
wckteajuea,6501,?how do these kids do that? wow hes flying and you got him and the shadow. great timing.
nfs30jzpf4,6502,"wow. a beautiful image, absolutely great, if you did hdr this, the job was very well done, and im not sure how else you could have gotten such a great image."
rf35hbiwvz,6503,"sharp, but theres quite a bit of digital noise there"
1ja0adffpa,6504,for me this is very flat in the tones.when im going to convert a picture to bw i push the huesaturation quite a bit to richen the tone
1ja0adffpa,6505,"i can see the reason you would go bw here, and i may well have done the same thing myself, but im not sure this particular conversion is the best one."
dstau3yzvc,6506,i do like the sepia tones. nice textures all around.
dstau3yzvc,6507,odd place for a building. nice photograph.

gjpn6tzy78,6520,excellent use of desaturation on the picture just enough to make it interesting to the viewer.well done
gjpn6tzy78,6521,"awesome, and i think the selective desat is a perfect touch."

lrdtkj81rv,6539,"spectaculr dramatic. elements fit together very nicely but the colors to me dont blend too well could be only me,"
lrdtkj81rv,6540,pretty punchy.perhaps a little oversaturated
lrdtkj81rv,6541,i like the idea.the clouds look a little off though.cant quiet figure out what doesnt seem to fit in the photograph.perhaps the darkness of the clouds in the front?
lrdtkj81rv,6542,very cool image. i love the contrast in colors and the clouds are supurb.
lrdtkj81rv,6543,too much hdr for my liking.

4vk2qdoh8k,6900,nice idea the colors are a bit flat.

zk37ken6rj,6918,"although i like the colour in this photo, it doesnt look like much planning or setup was involved."
l3zpyojne1,6919,"the picture is really grainy, but something about the grainess makes it interesting."
l3zpyojne1,6920,picture is too bright with the direct flash
l3zpyojne1,6921,too much flash kind hurt the photo. a more natural light tone would have been better.
l3zpyojne1,6922,"seems a little bright, rust color is nice though"
l3zpyojne1,6923,its really grainy but i think it goes well with the rust. maybe a bit too contrasted or oversaturated.
2fjhtx5ty3,6924,ive seen this in forum at highly rated without a fave and i so much enjoy this that i want to make it my fave but i dont want to push you out of that category. i would also think that a larger shadow would have helped so much here
e0gqtulp3p,6925,nice colors and movements from the clouds.
9yr136x61w,6926,"too bright, and is seems to have a rigid sharpness the dirupts the actual texture of the rust."

nfgxyq3d71,6991,"wonderful action, wonderful contrast!"
iug4heuqr1,6992,the selective desaturation here seems to be the because i can variety rather than something that adds to the image.
iug4heuqr1,6993,wonderful use of selective desat.
iug4heuqr1,6994,"i would have rather seen this all in colour, all bw or as a nice duotone."

0sprw44m2l,7005,looks unsharp. nice colours.
v4dzwzlhns,7006,"very neat motion blur, but i think that you could have made the photo a bit larger, which is normally a good idea"
sup0u43fzy,7007,nice capture. i would have liked the photo to have a little brighter colors. somewhat washed out look.
9nhyiaa1bs,7008,beautiful picture i saw a documentary the other day that said hummingbirds can see ultraviolet light and their colourings are even more outstanding to eachother. the colours in this pic are great i like the motion blur too. goodluck.

c197npxbg7,7016,this picture was taken on a dark overcast rainy day and because of that
c197npxbg7,7017,no doubt this is cute. i do think some burn and saturation would of increase the over all look and added some more interest. the colors are a little flat.

b970gupv0h,7076,what a lovely warm color of brown i havent seen one that color before.
fejir1faaz,7077,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
ja31b7psq6,7078,nice capture of a cardinal. well composed and sharp!
ja31b7psq6,7079,"clean and soft and gentle. nicely presented. she may be plainer than her male counterpart, but she has a quiet beauty of her own."
ja31b7psq6,7080,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
w60na63bzx,7081,"great capture, love the movement of gracefullness"
ncp86ph0pp,7082,"very well done, the blue does seem a little blue, but that is probably my moniture"
2g26d82jfo,7083,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
2g26d82jfo,7084,"great pose, to bad about the shadow line"
dco8ek29n7,7085,fantastic clarity and perfect against the blue.
dco8ek29n7,7086,excellent detail and very good job handling the exposure of the whites. he she? is a very good model!
eqpyuisiva,7087,a bit overexposed but good capture of the action.
9djhcvy9aw,7088,"nice capture of the duckes, sharp with good color and contrast"
e08emyorez,7089,"such a cool photo, wow hes got a big bill. very clear and detailed."
cyfkl2usve,7090,something odd about the editing on this one. maybe over sharpened some? good pose and capture though.
7hz5t0scvw,7091,"i love redpolls, they are very cute with that tinge of red. very nice light and detail here."
aa5shpjnym,7092,"a good action capture i do like the blur of wings in shots like these. a bit of color noise, but not too bad."
15t1cbnc96,7093,"if the yellow flowers around him were a different or darker color, it would enhance this conures color. charming though!"
v3ilat46c5,7094,a fine natural pose! this would benefit from a bit more light and contrast you can try adjusting the levels a bit and maybe a bit of brightnesscontrast adjustment. tis a very regal look you captured!
v3ilat46c5,7095,great photo but perhaps could have done with the contrast levels adjusting slightly to give the image a little more pop
7u12u9bk3t,7096,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
doju2vnf2f,7097,i really love the colors very natural but vibrant. wonderful detail.
cle54gjp8f,7098,awesome job on a really tough exposure.
ccze283i7y,7099,bit off a little more than he can chew huh? great detail and an entertaining capture.
kedx7b5gzl,7100,"this is an amazing capture. i wish i could find something like this. well deserved, woudl have guessed the blue though. wonderful job,"
r8mk2g591l,7101,lovely bright clean colours.
6oz5znjzcp,7102,"strange contrast of colors, nice photo."
ksw45mhh81,7103,amazing colour and capture detail is great
ksw45mhh81,7104,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
bfakqqrbqo,7105,"nice ans sharp, good colors and contrast and saturation. good job."
y75nmyq8lt,7106,broadbills are beautiful. a little blurry
p3uh0gz9a8,7107,this image has a surreal feel to it i love the movement but it almost looks oversharpened and gives a painted look to it but it works for me
p3uh0gz9a8,7108,"good take, strange colored pelicans."
5wxha0o80g,7109,"it appears t be very soft on my monitor, very nice capture though"
zr243rs73r,7110,"he really does look like hes showing off for you! i like the floating feathers. as for technicals, he lacks a bit of sharpness."
hoftm2gv0p,7111,exquisitely beautiful. your use of colors is astounding. glorious!
m1t2l7muxz,7112,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
8esxak7gd8,7113,"great sharpness, light and colournot sure i like what he is standing on!"
e0zhvyc1s0,7114,wow! how did you create this effect? its fantastic clarity and colour!
e0zhvyc1s0,7115,lots of contrast here and lots of color too. so much color from over saturation that it no longer looks real.
e0zhvyc1s0,7116,very well done. perfect exposure imo.
uq30448rmx,7117,so ethereal and misty. for my taste it cold have less noise. regardless.
uq30448rmx,7118,"great bw coversion as well, the noise and softness adds wonderfully to the ambience of the picture"
a0z02sn0eq,7119,"nice in bw, perhaps the whites could be a little whiter?"
a0z02sn0eq,7120,i dont care for the vignette or the bw. he sure made a mess on his perch.
d4mc1t7y6s,7121,nice and clear and good colour on the ducks but id love to see them closer.
jvth4v0mth,7122,very sweet and love the bw treatment and the detail
g9dt8nccgy,7123,gorgeous colors. great detail and texture.
ejg6r8l8j3,7124,nice use of silhouetteperhaps the contrast is over done.
axoxrha63r,7125,"nice contrasts, tones and backlighting."
xs1qpf34at,7126,too much contrast to have a real feel to it.
xs1qpf34at,7127,"nice image. wish it wasnt so dark with his surroundings, but looks very cool none the less."
glk5smx51l,7128,"i like the matching outfits, thats funny. soft, if no one else has noticed"
5fb5j0v4pf,7129,great movement in this pic i almost feel like i moving just looking at it! cool.
5fb5j0v4pf,7130,"thats a lot of gulls, could be around here. good colour"
ka05nofuea,7131,"not really sure what to say on this one. the gulls in motion is a great capture, it looks all rather fake though with all the processing that has been done. you may well have been going for that look, you have done a good job."
p2cg4ao623,7132,"i would love to see something like this in person. beautifully colorful birds, but unfortunately none are very sharp."
k38y3yzcmv,7133,nice capture.really tough catching these wo any motion blur.
u29zspnmox,7134,i like the soft grain feel to this. nice job.
u29zspnmox,7135,very nice pose i like the softness and grayness of this as well.
21w9e4o2rz,7136,"interesting editing choice, but i actually quite like the result. it gives the wings a great texture."
pjlfj7lxd9,7137,"great capture, impressive finish in a tough pack of contenders!"
9rnjsfrmwp,7138,"if this wasnt so grainy, imo it would look better. maybe not so much sharpening next time?"
12oklswuw2,7139,a fascinating experiment using the birds as texture.
f4ykjrni1e,7140,great detail and color on this wonderful capture!
ar0vs41mjl,7141,good job on the well deserved blue. birds are your category and you shined in this one.
ar0vs41mjl,7142,very nice details and contrast. bw is a good choice.
mygaqf8379,7143,"ha! i knew youd get the red! im still completely floored that it didnt get blue. awesome, awesome image!"
mygaqf8379,7144,"nesting season, i see! very graceful pose beautiful exposure to keep the whites in check."
e6wsfwhyp1,7145,good timing and a nice exposure.
3jmk8kj16p,7146,nice usage of grayscale.
tbjhhhoxmb,7147,an interesting highkey! i think it would work even in black and white.
tbjhhhoxmb,7148,pure as the driven snow.very unusual
ihiuicuxde,7149,its such a nice photo.advertisement quality to me.
bgvieyy7o1,7150,"lastly, this image could use just a bit of sharpening after you resized it for posting. and for studio shots like this, use a tripod if you have one. it can only help."
43qny0wo3i,7151,nice color balance and sharpness.
43nbi78goy,7152,in my opinion different cameras give different tones i love how nikon produce the yellows but olympus give you also incredibles colors and very real so if you have a good woodboard then you get good results
z4zrt58imi,7153,"strange effect in this pic, makes everything somewhat blurry."
bcoo2s3jgm,7154,maybe with no flash but a longer exposure it could have worked better!
pw97rcvfp2,7155,adjust colors a bit. seems kinda greenish.
g4q4saomv4,7156,nice cnontrasts of colors and textures.
4o0gypfsow,7157,a little too much neat image on the zebras ?
quvr89gu1g,7158,very good idea here! wish it was just a little brigher seems a bit underexposed.
yqa61al5vv,7159,i like the comp and the texture gradient.
6gcpugtzox,7160,awesome! i love the tone in this picture. its so peaceful and nice. could maybe explain for me how you processed it?
l7urg6hxxg,7161,"this is a lovely macro, nice smooth bits and pieces"
ubjp49x7or,7162,so thats where my old hot wheels went!
v05i1yv3m2,7163,i didnt hate the light difference at all. obviously nothing to worry about now. you deserved to win and did. and that is sometimes a rare thing.
v05i1yv3m2,7164,well deserved blue! this is amazing and i just admire you so much for the hard work you put in making your idea into a great photo
o220d6w505,7165,"very nice and essential, i like the colors and the texture a lot!"
78q4643upw,7166,i really like this picture. some real character. great colors too. love it
78q4643upw,7167,this is a stunning image with wonderful color and contrast.
ei7y6apz7x,7168,like that you added color elements to the still life to give it interest. needs to be sharper.
irzj2pibzl,7169,"i remember the old song.the primary colors are .red, yellow and blue . its a strange edit to me but i guess it works."
irzj2pibzl,7170,"nice use of color and bw, ive always liked that effect."
6ycd8048wa,7171,nifty. but the color cast is a bit flourescent for my taste.
r2f0webbod,7172,nice variety of colors and lines.
gqy20tkpz8,7173,"great collection. interesting shapes, textures and colors, pinks, oranges beiges and blues. if you have time to play, maybe simplify the number of colors, to provide a more unified feel."
gqy20tkpz8,7174,"lovely colors, shapes and textures"
gqy20tkpz8,7175,i love shells and these are some nice ones. a little more saturation and less sharpening i think would help.
njalcfpjcd,7176,nice variety of color and textures.
g84kmtfkp5,7177,this looks like an image from one of my childrens i spy books. great colors and a fun image to explore.
g84kmtfkp5,7178,so many bits an so many pieces. i love the color.
84246yvxy3,7179,"roses are red, violets are blue. most poems rhyme but this one dont! they broke my bones and ill name your photo ."
gv4pr61thj,7180,"love the colors, but the composed nature of such natural objects doesnt work for me. if they were manmade objects it would work for me."
l698sn7tj3,7181,good control of the light. good placement.
bsbyd9lf70,7182,great colours. good use of noise reduction
0wxh74kqtf,7183,"hey, thats cheating but very clever. it seems hazy thou."
wuqa37gkhp,7184,"uch, what a mess. youre a computer geek, arent you ?"
pl4zmy4cc6,7185,"impressive macro, i only wish it would have been in a vibrant green."
pl4zmy4cc6,7186,nice contrast and textures. the comp is interesting too.
9v19zlv577,7187,"really impressive work, lately, steve."
9v19zlv577,7188,proficiat with the red steve. and now i know what it is.
9v19zlv577,7189,"at first glance i thought, where are the bits andor pieces. duh! they are all riveted together! original and nice colors!"
a8qffzyl54,7190,nice colorful jumble of odds and ends.
a8qffzyl54,7191,"great picture, nice sharpness and colors."
64fkun7bl3,7192,i like the idea of the processing. i would have either taken it further or toned it down a bit. i get the feeling that this is somehow incomplete.
klyn12rtbp,7193,"heres the blue. i quickly perused the thumbnails and this image just jumped out at me. your dedication to complexity and construction of concepts is unequaled. a bit of a departure, too, in bw. wonderful."
l9cxnw8vy2,7194,good detail in the thumb but this image does not really grab me in any way at all.
v7xzkzhljk,7195,"it has a pink cast to it, was that purposeful?"
lageafepak,7196,"beautiful warm, still life but i dont really think of this as bits and pieces."
inpeqqk048,7197,"it is good but somehow unbalanced, maybe the light is too flat"
2xs53edwzk,7198,love the hint of red. brr
jo2i86qart,7199,indeed but wheres the pieces? nice soft tones.
eiej0smcxz,7200,"ha! a unique battle for certain, great humor. btw, lydia is correct, and it pains me to say that!"
5c2ij4vlww,7201,proficiat! excellent. the blue no less.
dse7w3s60u,7202,awesome im glad you got some red bling. i really thought that two parts fit the description of pieces to me. very nice.
wgicz6l0u1,7203,"nice and sharp, well photographed, but safety pins in a blister pack is not terribly interesting to me."
d1e93aymo9,7204,great detail in this photo. like the desaturated feel im guessing cause it is slightly.
h7k2omycsa,7205,love the colors and processing. the image exudes cheer.
kh057vxvyq,7206,"im not terribly fond fond of the blue, but this is a great idea and fairly well executed."
rfhkbf7m4g,7207,"thats interesting. not bad as it stands, though perhaps it could benefit from a modest bump in contrast and saturation, just to give it a little more visual pop."
zchrwkayzj,7208,ahh! this is wonderfully blurry! it has a dreamnightmare like feel. could be out of a movie! awesome.
kcx3cflhtc,7209,not overly fond of the reddish tint but it does make the building look more bizarre than it normally would.
jq5yt273uo,7210,this is really neat! kind of surreal.
jq5yt273uo,7211,beautiful contrast of colors very cool sunject
unql2gaxx2,7212,nice use of a color negative.
unql2gaxx2,7213,meh. would this building really be that bizarre if you hadnt inverted the colors for everything?
r2hay750a1,7214,not sure how bizarre this is nice colors
vauh60tlhu,7215,im glad she was saved from demolition. youve succeeded in showing the colours correctly usually shes more greyish in colour photographs
7c4appluxr,7216,i think heshes pretty good looking! nice color and sharpness.
o8r6uwde6c,7217,where i live our trees dont change color.
9k2y2zctxn,7218,neat image is allowed in the basic editing rules reread the rules
ku13kvg2ys,7219,"beautiful, lovely, and amazing. nice colors and light in this picture."
7j17e63kek,7220,"this is a great image. you also stand out since its an excellent example of a cpativating photo using pastel colors, rather than bold colors."
7j17e63kek,7221,"amazing, lovely pastel shades."
7j17e63kek,7222,flamingos.oh my what a shot.a bit more contrast and you have a double blue
0icllk2u4b,7223,nice macro and awesome colors.
ozsq0ksdv0,7224,"great mood, very somber pic"
lobko647vd,7225,wow. what peculiar cloudy swirls
lobko647vd,7226,great colors. whats bizzarre ?
qwbuf16eei,7227,"now, that is pretty freakin bizarre. seems a little grainy and outoffocus, though."
9yd7xjxprc,7228,"haha, this one made me chuckle. there is little too much noise in the image though."
5wcvommilw,7229,green tint in the bottom distracts
xmqcybk4of,7230,perhaps a little too dark. nothing jumps out and says funny or bizzare.
0h0fwf2ooz,7231,thats an amazing colour great capture.
ni808y460k,7232,love this pic. great color and diversity.
ni808y460k,7233,very colorful. gotta love those cute miniature pumpkins.
luivi5o97b,7234,wow.weird! cool shot!love the colors
luivi5o97b,7235,"interesting, bizarre and the colors work well together."
luivi5o97b,7236,"i like this a lot, and think it definitely applies to the topic. may have been a stronger image in bw, but thats a matter of personal taste."
luivi5o97b,7237,i like the geometery and the colour contrast to the limb.
shlq56t4n7,7238,a lot of nice movement in this photo.
h6sdoadqcx,7239,love the contrast in the colors of the longhorn to the grassleaves around it.
wfioj5dino,7240,good bw. lovely contrast of colors.
eshczf2zrn,7241,a lovely graphic image nice subtle colors.
3azfupmrut,7242,"very cool, no pun intended. i like the almost sepia quality of this"
j5a23h27vf,7243,well done! great image quality here with the new hardware.
argy5fpflt,7244,very striking. grr white thingy!
7x2sbv8kav,7245,way over sharp and it look like you relied to much on photoshops highlight tool. a
xfrq5h50oy,7246,would prefer the natural colors instead of the heavy cyan.
ki7boz85gj,7247,fantastic! great colors and texture! the only thiing that irks me is the blurred needles in the forefront. otherwise wonderful!
ulvgv0z5g3,7248,"the image is way too bright, imho."
unvb40a6i7,7249,amazing colors and shapes. good job.
if39hyui3e,7250,wtg on a new personal best! love the colors
if39hyui3e,7251,"thats beautiful, so colorful and detailed.great photo."
if39hyui3e,7252,mushrooms are pretty interesting but that green is crazy.
if39hyui3e,7253,"love the colors and textures of this. and nature will grow something just about anywhere, wont she?"
gv96pgvnus,7254,"otherwise, good job on the detail and exposure!"
oap8ms961y,7255,this is way oversharpened. look at the white glow along all the edges.
2df5u1o279,7256,i like the climbing effect of the orange smokecloud
2df5u1o279,7257,"wow i love this, its a perfect halloween type picture as well.its so dark but you can still see everything you need to. wonderful."
5i9x3c7582,7258,never saw one of these before. excellent choise for this topic. im wondering if this could be just a tad brighter with a bit more contrast? but still marvelous.
9nkz2n53c5,7259,good idea but the color of the spores seems too pale.
f2phsu5d5o,7260,"great colors, and amazingly good sharpness on the whole object"
qy2jp8bw7j,7261,"great colors! this is so unusual, im glad to see the validated notice at the bottom."
qy2jp8bw7j,7262,awesome colors! what a terrific find!
qy2jp8bw7j,7263,i like the colour and patterns of nature what the heck if it isnt that bizzare
rtxz9r4t8l,7264,looks like you edged me at the finish line . great job laurie!
lvs6jil91i,7265,"good job on finding something interesting. i always respect the more unique shotsideas, and this is one of them."
lvs6jil91i,7266,hahahaha. its nice. just a lil bit grainy
72ucx9vm78,7267,classic treatment this well done
p4era7gg7i,7268,"excellent! would love to know where this was taken might like it a little bluer, but that is just a guess."
d80ujwiutl,7269,very unique idea! never in a million years wouldve thought of this. nicely composed and toned.
ysw5xitb11,7270,good black on black. lots of visible detail without turning grey.
7s3qb68701,7271,nice use of black against a color. the black seems blacker against the light blue and offwhite.
zqgsxvkhyh,7272,are you a go player? if you are then you thought that nobody will know what a ko is. i would have loved to see a photo of a real ko. black involves the existence of white anyway so you could take a photo of the blacks and the whites.
w0idd7pgdo,7273,its a keyboard? can tell more from the thumbnail than from the actual picture. did you use a filter to get the effect? i like it.
w0idd7pgdo,7274,"ok, i dont know how this relates to black, or what purpose the blurred effect whether produced in setup or postprocessing serves."
73trd8ysj1,7275,i really like the monochrome fee that the greens create. they compliment the black very nicely. very nice image.
qerjogeko1,7276,holy smokes. did you say all female. eek. very interesting image. very dark in a good way.
4woxoez4sy,7277,"very nicely done, just enough information to know what your looking at, and just enough mystery to truly be magic."
3n12k9iayl,7278,regis! i like the ensamble. also there is just enough light to retain the black without going too much into grey.
3n12k9iayl,7279,i thnk the hilights could be a lot brighter if you pushed the blacks blacker as well.
a62fxevhtd,7280,seems to have quite a bit of noise. decent macro though
kalf5sq9mf,7281,"cool photo, not sure about the black thing though"
bubx4ktq0m,7282,"beautiful, beautiful! such a soft pretty picture. well done!"
y58x9x1qbc,7283,i hate to say this coz everyone else has already . its a bit dark.
y58x9x1qbc,7284,"nice, but a bit too dark on both my monitors! barely perceptible person."
y58x9x1qbc,7285,on my screen the colour tone seems just a touch greeny but not overpoweringly so.
pd7bo94l4k,7286,"excellent idea, what says black better than a big ole caddy?"
tu4gy88fvs,7287,it looks like the real black ones were handled too much. the should be shinny black. bol
vt54ayebt3,7288,nope i cant.bc its way too dark
yc0rpgousq,7289,whats that tiny bit of blue doing there?
781dqyvylf,7290,interesting black and rd study.
i1lh6ox5bq,7291,interesting how the fingernails seem almost rotten after the postprocessing you did on this photograph. i like how it adds to the effect.
i1lh6ox5bq,7292,"i had negative photography in mind aswell, great texture!"
39jrr75j6o,7293,"i think this one should win just because. other than that, i love the look bw gave to the interesting stonework of the building! great job!"
hkwxk5wa0x,7294,kind of strange. hard to tell whats really black and whats just dark.
73iklq442n,7295,great arrangement with an awesome light and a very clean white. the image could be from a design study. hope you do very well.
rysvzyq2zx,7296,"im not reading much balance, it seems rightheavy to me. great detail though!"
6eqc5m2bxv,7297,i do wish you had more shades of grey in tere
6eqc5m2bxv,7298,an absorbing image. my only criticism is that maybe the highlights could have been toned down a bit but thats very personal. excellent work
dg0u20kcsm,7299,"its not a guess the macro, gezz all you guys reley on black bacgrounds wheres the originality"
d9yyqn0s78,7300,"heh, no kidding. nice play with the absorption of light."
qtiukpg1r0,7301,if all the jackets can be black. itd be great. d
k11liy26ek,7302,"ohh. good job! minimal to the extreme, but very well done. i can follow the edge all the way down to the stem."
k11liy26ek,7303,"awesome texture, and good light control."
wl22zoijnq,7304,nice snap.sharper shadow would have been better though
qx2n9hiyh0,7305,"more grey than strikingly black white. this doesnt really speak to me, if thats not too pretentious. there are lots of interesting angles, light shadow, detail, etc. but you havent really made much of it, im afraid."
ml9kicjwi5,7306,are the cards so old they are yellowing? or is the white balance off. you should be able to achieve perfect black and white with this one.
ml9kicjwi5,7307,idea fits the challege. their systems to be a red cast to the picture though.
lx3l3n1vy4,7308,"i like this picture.a little more silvery than black and white, but i like it!"
lx3l3n1vy4,7309,very beautiful seascape. i like different tones of grey in it.
xif1kub3yv,7310,i dont think this qualifies as a bw photo taken in color!
extei7h58m,7311,its not bad at all i like the shapes and colors. maybe with light it went wrong because the plates look different.
bos2ngpyf6,7312,try to use a noise filter next time. good idea!
bos2ngpyf6,7313,"another option is to set the exposure to about . thatll reduce the time the shutters open, which should reduce the blur, and you can brighten in software later."
cc32tu59ao,7314,"im wondering about the whitebalance or something, as he she looks kind of blue. in colour, that is, not mood!"
035ubgb52h,7315,i love the intensity of the stare. has that dont mess with me look. lol
ml45ksdsjv,7316,i dont get it. where is the black and white. imho dnmc
xpirety6m3,7317,and so it ends. a for pure allegorical power.
v031rq7b1v,7318,the picture is soft and i feel it dnmc due to too much color.
rxrv85a5fu,7319,"this seems to be, to be the opposite of a bw photo taken in color."
0y1smsx7qm,7320,and youve added some drama with a beautiful shadow full of texture.
6bi04abzu1,7321,it would be cool to see this in black and white. but a cool image never the less!
6bi04abzu1,7322,really great boldness of black and white in this one. nice graphic feel to it.
dxml0grx2i,7323,a stunning photo. i love the one bright whisker on him. great job.
dxml0grx2i,7324,some light would help on this to get that one sweet white whisker!
dxml0grx2i,7325,excellent photo love the subtle difference in hues and the one light wisker.
dxml0grx2i,7326,"sorry, just cannot see it just a bit too dark."
dxml0grx2i,7327,"im sure im not the first to tell you, a little too much black and not enough white. hard to tell what is in the picture."
iedq4ed9xn,7328,i would like to see a sharper line at the eggs edge where it meets the shadow
iedq4ed9xn,7329,"i have complaints about this image, which could have been made better with just a little better postprocessing."
iedq4ed9xn,7330,. noise. that pretty much speaks for itself.
q9m6t0yead,7331,how did you get him to hold still through this time exposure? great job.
ztc963r6t5,7332,touch of red and all sorts of green.
z5k3o8w561,7333,very rich looking like diamonds and black pearls.
ivuej4g3bw,7334,seems a bit blurred and glarey
ivuej4g3bw,7335,"it looks very overprocessed, and is clearly not black and white. dnmc"
susohm4wzw,7336,"your light is way too bright. i understand you used the bright light for your black and white effect, but its still to bright."
l3wwk3ztmo,7337,i think you have created good atmosphere of sadness defeat using exposure as well as shadows
as6z0l5s2u,7338,"missing a little pop in the white areas, keep at it. though."
40uoxuxt7i,7339,excellent shot.loved the touch of green color
z171kigj62,7340,"i see more color then black and white, dnmc imo"
3hapnvhyzz,7341,very harsh light. looks overexposed with blownout highlights.
l4vvwu0d7n,7342,cant think of a better selection of black and white.
b9onecvx5o,7343,the only issue i have is that the stem is black only because it is super underexposed.
g8vgeztv5d,7344,yum! i love the pop of color that the light bulbs bring to the photo.
g8vgeztv5d,7345,this is sort of cool. light and darkness.
4sl1xo0rx2,7346,the texture of the white lines is very interesting
xj7dep9pz1,7347,that was a great classic movie and that is a super take on it!
3senkvenj4,7348,lots of effort.but it looks kind of pink. at least on this screen
dlrbx2inbx,7349,too little contrast but a great fresh idea.
6j7td07p0w,7350,"i feel that this image is waay overprocessed it could have been your intention but it did not do much for me. nice zebras, though!"
6j7td07p0w,7351,"a bit too oversaturated for my taste, and there are areas that look almost blue."
kvn1f8mtv3,7352,fabulous! but the red throws me a little
xj2196bsig,7353,sorry but my understanding was that the image was to be black and white greyscale
xj2196bsig,7354,the image shows a good deal of noise
2dzm2teh0u,7355,starin at those four gray walls in silence he would listen
2dzm2teh0u,7356,st i want to say con gratz on the blue ways to go.this is awesome i cant wait for the day. way to go!
2dzm2teh0u,7357,woo hoo! first blue here! everybody look! first blue! gotta love it!
hvvd9me66k,7358,"nice things, nice varieties of bw, but what brings them together?"
hvvd9me66k,7359,"my son just said, mom you should have done oreo cookies. great idea. then i came upon this picture. nice photo. did a great job with black and white in color."
vaegc2x08f,7360,i enjoyed this photo alot. very nice colors.
tu0lgpwd09,7361,fabulous! perhaps more light would provide more clarity? id like to see all of the writing in vivid white
o4x4vgcglu,7362,"this appears to be a black and white image, not a color one. maybe im wrong, cause i really like it."
kniaalyyd4,7363,"nice detail, lovely capture, maybe a bit too much off of the pearls."
nqhdnozoet,7364,seems like a lot of green for a bw photo?
fvqksshj1v,7365,good texture study and macro
fe79fddt3h,7366,"wow, you really captured the texture of him! he looks silky smooth. great photo."
fclcpdlyof,7367,"love the blurring between collage and photography. but be careful, blur is punished around here!"
t7k1hmhfk2,7368,"fourth as above, image grain or noise is generally frowned upon. there are instances where is can add character, but most of the time it is best to avoid it. noise reduction software such as neat image or noise ninja exists on the market some versions are free."
t7k1hmhfk2,7369,download some noise reduction software. you can get a free version of neat image off the web.
t7k1hmhfk2,7370,a little oversaturated to be black white in color.
t7k1hmhfk2,7371,im sorry i dont see anything bw. dnmc for me.
osalo2flxz,7372,"good effort, slight blurring at the front but i like it"
osalo2flxz,7373,i reckon this is good. only problem raisins are brown? anyway well done.
uqofv462z8,7374,i still feel there is too much blue and green hue
c72gnyy7y1,7375,"too much color to be on topic, in my opinion."
z53h7qnqlx,7376,"irene and techo, look out. . .melethia is hot on your heels"
uf0tcofdlx,7377,that is classic epic heart.nice
od9wlo8lhd,7378,nice sharp image and great pose
57sbdeddc4,7379,neat use of shapes. deeper shadows would have emphasized them even more though
yzwdzc24ra,7380,damn. i think maybe this is the most literal use of black and white in colour that ive ever seen. heh.
ztgumrb6bb,7381,"too much contrast , loosing too much details in the highlights insufficient details in the shadow areas"
2378u7c6f5,7382,im not sure why but i dig this. did you throw light at this? or is it natural?
2378u7c6f5,7383,great texture and gloss.
fyw6y1s3ro,7384,"clever, i would like it lit a tad bit more i had to stare at it for a while to see that the sholder is there at all. i like that it is dark and hiding in the shadow but it is a tiny bit too much"
fyw6y1s3ro,7385,its a pity about the yellow highlight otherwise very good
fyw6y1s3ro,7386,"perhaps a bit too dark, in my opinion. id like just a tad bit more detail."
so6t0uhgrz,7387,i like the slight hint of pink in the flowers
uvzcsv9523,7388,yep agree! i guess the lil brownish tint was the main let down for this
er26ey42qz,7389,maybe not black and white but she is still beautiful. great portrait.
jqsnq0iwl7,7390,"wonderful capture, i love the soft misty feel to it."
kb1jxkeg6j,7391,where did you find these black and white candies? amazing!
577zhc5hly,7392,"hm. like this pic, but is it black and white in color or color in color"
8de1gbd6di,7393,"interesting idea, but brown and yellow isnt black and white."
8de1gbd6di,7394,"good idea, but the problem here is that there is neither any true white nor black giving the photo way too little contrast."
u49yw7kz5g,7395,wonderful photo. the touch of colour is perfect.
kl5kvgmctt,7396,"too much hotspots and contrast , not a good thing."
mt8h0dludx,7397,brown and white aint the same as black and white. sorry.
5n2yymtw2d,7398,"ive never seen it with such detail. will make an effort to see the less obvious details, the wholeness of it, from now on."
avnslqgpqt,7399,love the details in the textures. very nice soft mood you created.
5ik8lau5ym,7400,"really nice pic, but, sorry, where is black or white?"
5ik8lau5ym,7401,"is this a wrong submission, pretty much the opposite of black and white"
5ik8lau5ym,7402,".dnmc , but im certain you already know that. otherwise a for a beautiful image, excellent play of light and shadow and use of dofpov."
f8kxahz9xx,7403,beautiful work here. i admit i love all things caffienated. exposure is dead on perfect.
92bfmhydzo,7404,i like the idea but the red and green sets if off of bw
6bne9pq8wx,7405,"nice idea, but i feel that some of the white areas are a bit too hot, there also seems the be a good deal of grain in the darker areas."
s3xrtqyv8q,7406,"sorry, but imho the description was pretty clearly that the photo should look like a black and white picture, not symbolize the many possible meanings of black and white."
mewlsqq5co,7407,i just dont see this as a black and white photo. not enough white and way too much brown.
o22uxe32pk,7408,if you had a little more detail in the photographer then this picture would be perfect!
a7ug8rwuxf,7409,"ive heard of black sabbath, but black easter? cute idea, well executed"
iaauik3qau,7410,this is such a cute idea and it is black and white! great job!
9bxzwp3yxr,7411,"i like this, it has a bluish tint on my display"
9bxzwp3yxr,7412,"there is definitely a blue tint to this image. it wouldnt be that noticeable except for the fact that all of the other images are completely black and white, so a little bit of color really stands out."
w5izzn7sme,7413,the balance of this photo is great. and the contrast of textures makes it more calming.
w5izzn7sme,7414,infra red processing very nice.
f1o03wzmmt,7415,"ahh , well i guess this is very beautiful in color, but in bw it does nothing for me,"
p2fjxky81n,7416,i would have liked to see more contrast between the grain and the fields in this one.
izouz29nu0,7417,nice exposure. love the varying tones in the rocks.
gge3il5r87,7418,"some old world charm, i like the texture here."
25l3zzc8k9,7419,"oh, your clouds are soo noisy.but you do have good rich tone"
s7sdy76d8j,7420,this would be an amazing picture but lacks detail in the shadows or some thing.
w3ymrhi9ea,7421,"yup, were getting there! nice tones. love the light on the rocks, too!"
lldtr3qivh,7422,"this seems to be oversharpened and your tones dont have that rich, rich vibrant tone"
6ii86xymxf,7423,imo this could use a good dose of usm and a noise filter.
8ktkydsv7g,7424,"oh, wow. this is awesome. great tones, great reflections, great light, great processing. did i mention i think this is great? faving it."
liiihekjsf,7425,"very impressive picture, taken at night time ? see nobody there, like this one,"
qgmf5v9lvv,7426,lovely shades of light gray.
5anxdc0elf,7427,"front page stuff. personally i like a warm brownish tone, but this works."
cugxmzwugf,7428,youve lost alot of your detail in the shadows.did you do a shadowshighlights.imo it could have really helped the darkest areas in this and one last thing.usm
pfc0n6ered,7429,nice sharp image with a great vignette. presented a touch bright for my liking but pleasant enough.
x0getpir0l,7430,i like the separation of tones in the trees. the clouds look a little bit pixilated on my monitor.
g4jai50lmt,7431,"for me the image feels a bit underexposed in the shadows, so you are losing some of the detail."
g4jai50lmt,7432,"finally, i do find the image to be a little over sharp. i think its very difficult to get sharpening correct for images with a lot of detail. its very easy to over cook."
6q294afo7c,7433,"it adds a lot having the birds there. seems dark to me, but it could be my work monitor. great comp."
eh1d9c7iqw,7434,"got to love those cloudless skies not.it was the same for me,such bright, bright sun.i will say that at least you have clarity and detail!"
gyx7k6t7hu,7435,nice black and white conversion but there may be a little too much going on here
gyx7k6t7hu,7436,the detail is excellent. there is alot going on in this picture and its interesting to check out. nice work!
70lenk16mk,7437,has a harsh feel to it which is not a criticism the processing suits the mood of the image so to speak.
7vv8wt3vc9,7438,excellent use of light and motion.
ubgpudarxy,7439,love the way you caught the clouds but seems to be not enough contrast in the hillsides
ubgpudarxy,7440,not sure what happened here.im not sure if you did usm or not.you seem to have lost detail in the reducing of the picture imo
x3n4f7ptbr,7441,good leading lines especially with the ups and downs. too much contrast for my taste would have preferred more midtones.
423y10soi2,7442,"what beautiful, awesome shadows light!"
423y10soi2,7443,the backlighting is so very effective. beautiful capture
qphqo2sxwf,7444,i like your contrast and this image has a dreamlike fell to it.
f3lqdevam0,7445,lovely contrasts in tone and texture. nice compositinal elements here.
f3lqdevam0,7446,"this is a true blue black and white photo. yet, the ambient light is completely being blocked out by the complete look of black and white. still a nice photo."
nil8cn18h9,7447,over sharpened white halos on the edges.
mckbuu5c1g,7448,nice job on the longer exposure to get that silky effect.
18vyku2kcv,7449,an amazing amount of detail in this image. im pleased that there is so much to see and youve made it possible to do so.
vdj6tnzorj,7450,this image could be adjusted using hdr technique. there are very dark areas that make a hard contrast with the light areas.
64fyasoe1a,7451,wow this is cool. great black and white and lovely to see the different layers of clouds.
qk3wysdid2,7452,hi sean.was just thinking about you! great play with the light.
l0a7vuyfjf,7453,i really like how balanced this photo is. and the whiteout works. nice job.
8wkbd07p04,7454,"lots of different shades of grey, black and white good job"
w497hgzqji,7455,"cool, i get a real sence of motion"
awag5cc6uc,7456,"beautiful as it is, but the color version wow!"
eforgmceaw,7457,green? color process issue?
eforgmceaw,7458,"the tinge of green doesnt work for me, im afraid."
ilmo3mprzp,7459,there are some odd shadows at the edges of your white bldg.
go85x1du0k,7460,"nice contrast of whites, grays and blacks"
djgru5j8pk,7461,i think the idea is good but i just cant see enough of the dividing line.
3saupjuy7e,7462,i love the way blue skys look in bw. nice job.
ia86yh6qph,7463,for me this is a bit underexposed and dark.a lot of detail is lost
j02mja5bta,7464,gorgeous! incredible mood. fave and would be surprised if front page.
gk6iwjmvou,7465,i also feel the image is a bit over sharpened. i dont know its really necessary to use both sharpen and usm. i think a touch of usm before saving for the web is probably enough.
j2irmwc7qb,7466,lovely. perfect exposure. a subtle beauty.
z0jtb53hdx,7467,good display of the different scales of grey.
z0jtb53hdx,7468,"nice contrast, which is key to bw. also has quite a bit of interest. nice and sharp without being too sharp."
m7a56k46g8,7469,good use of light on the cliffs.
6tmac8qm2u,7470,great job of isolating the white object given the limitations of basic editing. the photo is stark and dramatic nice job pp.
p06g9pzokj,7471,i like the dark feel to the whole image.
59jhc5kt44,7472,"i like the lines created by the mountains, but the differences in gray are so subtle that they almost disappear."
59jhc5kt44,7473,nice use of gradient light.
u5bz675pw8,7474,too blown out for my taste in the light areas and not enough detail in the dark areas.
u5bz675pw8,7475,a bit overdone with the contrast for me.
hx0jvyi4f7,7476,i like the motion in this and the contrast been the lines and the trees.
zmy7sl7ouz,7477,translates very well into bw. lovely capture.
7tebgv09d1,7478,for me this is to much shadow and not enough detail.its like its neither shadow or detail.
4vg2mkwwji,7479,the bw tones here really emphasize the amazing texture in these rocks. well done!
42zi41hz6l,7480,waterfalls tend to work very well in bw this is certainly no exception. nicely done.
q29mu120uz,7481,"incredible, smooth and clear reflections! lovely image!"
mxx7ys3ad5,7482,i like the layers here. the rough texture in the rocks and the soft roll of the hills give this a nice balance. the black and white in the rocks looks great.
vtghymxxb0,7483,excellent tonality. id have liked to see the tops of the trees though.
vtghymxxb0,7484,a bit otherworldly with your choice of exposure processing
7zwjb8abbp,7485,the whites could be still brighter without losing contrast in this well detailed image.
zimr29tql1,7486,"the softness here implies a memory, reinforced by the use of monchrome. nicely done."
eyhoyip3gs,7487,"i find the bw too flat, not enough whites for me."
71vyv0rulz,7488,this looks like florida to me.sun is a bit bright and harsh
sj30x69irt,7489,good light and converging lines
anwctwhwr0,7490,awesome. great tones great texture in the rocks.
bulss6dkcb,7491,a touch dark and a noise filter could have really helped this out
3vmnv8kecp,7492,nice twisted trees and great contrast. a job well done.
t22us0ukor,7493,nowhere near your best work. the bw feels really flat to me.
2ohh7nx4wp,7494,i like the balance of the different sections
dk1rv7cd3g,7495,leading lines and overal great detail make this
dk1rv7cd3g,7496,i hope someday to be able to create this effect in bw. what conversion software do you use? front page.
wsl9rctmfs,7497,this is a nice shot.couple of things.it seems to be lacking in usm and a noise filter.
cexh7x8y1k,7498,wow lisa! you have gorgeous lips. love the grainy steaminess.
jkpyjfltqt,7499,"for the ones who asked for a color version of this picture,"
kauh6n4v3g,7500,"interesting, and at least it doesnt look the same as every other photo submitted, but i dont think the grainy look works."
kauh6n4v3g,7501,"im not sure what the technical reason for the graininess is, but oddly enough, i like the effect, and find the photo to be interesting to look at."
30z3wxt8vr,7502,here is the webpage for the blue lagoon
7yqj43bhe9,7503,"i too prefer the bw version, a very romantic picture. love it!"
7yqj43bhe9,7504,"looked at the color as well and much prefer the b w version. beautiful picture, well done and soo mysterious which it loses in the color version."
7yqj43bhe9,7505,this is lovely and having looked at the colour version i much much prefer this black and white one. a beautiful and mysterious image.
7yqj43bhe9,7506,ive seen the colour version of this im devious like that which is absolutely breathtaking. would be an if you could have entered it.
7yqj43bhe9,7507,very nice. mysterious. sexy. beatiful.
wp8hqcb52g,7508,neat. was this picture taken in san antonio? or wherever the alamo is
gsxt9ic9m2,7509,very original. i like it. nice shadow work. jacko.
u69k9kb4sl,7510,"damn, you good photographers make me jealous. good job but a smidge flat. i think a little more light to make your whites a little stronger to give the image more contrast. just guessing!"
ofmza5fb0y,7511,to much light. a softer light would have been nice. she is beautiful.
8dtkixh8wp,7512,dang.if only more contrast. this has great potential.
kj39c3e865,7513,"this could have been a nice picture, but you either overedited it, or used a bad compression method. what a waste of your pretty model."
mt2t03bmnw,7514,i really like this photograph. great texture and contrast. god yes.
mt2t03bmnw,7515,this is an amazing portrait of the highest quality.

ksk9cusr51,7520,cute! lol . nice light.
q2hw3akrhz,7521,"great work, but for the slight softness that looks as though it might be due to motion blur. love the contrasts though and the light. theres something about young kids with such serious looks on their faces that makes for a great photo."
bwkroj8kjz,7522,"lacking in contrast, but a good effort none the less. keep practising!"
2evy4rmk1e,7523,a well lit and nicely setup portrait. .good contrast and skintones
xf2l2tdq4h,7524,very well balanced bw conversion. beautiful model
o0lc3bsxek,7525,"an attempt at brown, i definitely help you with your goal."
0boxq27ayk,7526,the coloured image of this photo would probably be nice.
1lfv0smv4w,7527,"not bad for a highcontrast bw. something is missing, but i cant figure it out."
73ssfgvxpt,7528,good bw of youth today.
yg1whybwex,7529,perfect in bw! love the softness and elegance youve created. just wonderful!

84g9ycfdot,7542,"falleg mynd af fallegri stelpu sigrn. nice portrait and i love the light, very well done o"
84g9ycfdot,7543,the way it is taken clearly indicates that it is taken by experienced hands. i like everything about it. everything is well balanced.
rbh4nxwjhh,7544,"very nice tone, but im not sure brown and white is black and white. excellent portrait though."
na0rkqi4nw,7545,a bit unsharp othervise good portrait

ed3moh0jc6,7547,"interesting, mysterious and original image."

qv40ytb5cz,7549,"motion blur doesnt work, sorry."
d9chiie2q3,7550,"very good! i love the grainyedgy look to it, but it also has a softness and almost sadness to it. great job."
d9chiie2q3,7551,"i like the transiton from the light blown to the dark, as well as the granularity."
d9chiie2q3,7552,nice use of grain on this portrait
d9chiie2q3,7553,cool.the graininess works well in the picture.
0g63cv6y5d,7554,"i see a bw image . actually, more like black and sepia. but what i dont see is a portrait. sorry."

0umg8oq64f,7556,the blur is terrible im sorry.
h9d9c02zs4,7557,this is interesting. i like the light. different approach with a certain artfulness.
omejixo9vc,7558,"what i am saying, if this would have been the same colorized idea but setup as a traditional portrait it would be an easy and rare from myself. as it stands it is just average even though the idea was awesome."
omejixo9vc,7559,"and red, and brown, and pink. almost, but not quite there"
omejixo9vc,7560,"pretty good portrait, but wasnt it meant to be a black white image? or am i being too literal?"
64g4ooc8vp,7561,i see lots of portrait with verry badharsh flash light. i dont understand why so many. i would prefere natural light outdors.
oz3zcvwgey,7562,"what a cutie. lovely light, cute catchlights."
mt2fi3j0pd,7563,the pose looks sort of uptight but a very good bw conversion.
hgpkf5hpcm,7564,"a classic beauty. nice setup, nice image"
v8hm8xu4dp,7565,"gorgeous! beautiful light, tones, contrasts."
uzo2x0qg9h,7566,"youve probably already heard this a lot, but the blue for me is a no no. sorry."
uzo2x0qg9h,7567,"little underexposed in my opinion. great softness, and i like the selective color."
uzo2x0qg9h,7568,uhohh. . you are probably hearing this alot. . but. . .umm. . the pinks and blues arent black or white. sorry!

o3vj2cwviz,7574,unusual and dramatic.im sure youll get hammered for it not being a real portrait.but i think its captivating. i also happen to like the grain in it.something about black and white and grain.a kind of marriage made in the s.
o3vj2cwviz,7575,"different, original, and excellent. too grainy? who cares, thats not where im looking. everything here works, well done. ."
st7u2q11xc,7576,imo the dark shadow that is on the bottom of the guitare really detracts from the photo.
2myr2tkobe,7577,nicely done excellent balance storytelling.
2myr2tkobe,7578,too bright washes out the details
wxebzx0bk2,7579,use yellow bedding and sheets next time.

jqdcxmm4iv,7585,"beautiful model, very interesting pose , good textures and lovely black and white tones."
yr1pixracz,7586,dreadful use of blur. kills the image imo

ygt9xv66ny,7588,"i know what youre going for, and i tihnk itd look better with more light on her eyesface."
66e8b274pm,7589,i like the backlighting . nice balance for the image
66e8b274pm,7590,"nice action! maybe a bit oversharpened, but its still a good one"
oke6xzu3yn,7591,softness effect a bit overdone
y0xrud6bfg,7592,great mood and artistic photo
eqvvlxewfl,7593,this one is a bit too dark and contrast heavy imo.
eqvvlxewfl,7594,"very nice character study! just a tad too much contrast for my taste, though."
1si6nzje2u,7595,one of the few in the contest where a bit of general overexposure works.
i2qtmdfjfl,7596,this looks like a movie starlet photo from the s or s. perfect amount of sharpening if this was the intention. great photo!
z4n4db8xn9,7597,a bit dark. i wonder if you have a flat screen monitor. i have one and it tends to show my photos much brighter than on nonflat screen monitors.
ptcpe3z49y,7598,"nice job with the light looks like your model is trying to hide, but cannot."
uypyfrg2yw,7599,excellent work. what kind of light you used?
uypyfrg2yw,7600,nice feel to the tonality of this one. i like it.
bdjq68e3xy,7601,pupils look very flat some catchlights there would make this a much better image.
2l2jo5tw9z,7602,beautiful soft tones and like the way shes not that easy to see .
39ng3bvwyq,7603,nice use of chiaroscuro.
39ng3bvwyq,7604,nice conversion. good contrast.

qtoemcrg3e,7609,great idea for a photo just wish the shadow were not present
matrg8pazb,7610,"wow, thats almost a true monochrome. too blue for me."
jhlbc35twj,7611,"excellent study of the ageing, well toned."
ufkjlhkuf3,7612,nice character study but a bit oversharp imo.
wx9vqtnqvx,7613,"awesome message, but the portrait is too dark try to brighten the mid tones"
hjk27kn2bg,7614,nice contrast and the shadow behind her adds an interesting touch
qby0bpafyt,7615,super cute. just wish the foggy parts werent there. what a powerful picture. would have been a ten from me.
qby0bpafyt,7616,"noo. this could of been great, but whats with the hazy bit at the topbottom. you really have killed a great image with a bit of poor processing. the framingcomposition were bang on. such a shame."
7hk7je6pi4,7617,flat lightin. oncamera flash?
1hsul2vt36,7618,needs to be darker and sharper imo.
8eog6126fw,7619,"this is a nice candid, but the coloring is too gray. the skintones are too shadowed."
fuvfhkz05y,7620,"wow. lotsa blur. cute kids, though."
zfxvg7b7by,7621,interesting idea but not really a portrait also i dont like the flowers in colour
hk6tymeb1u,7622,"its pretty obvious who the photographer is, but let that be a testiment to the pure quality that ive seen from you."
5rkdj404lg,7623,i rated this picture a . i love the dark sinister look. you did a great job!
bvpq66ztgw,7624,ps.who has perfectly smooth feet. i want to know what they use for lotion because i need some in a bad why.lol

3mbk2vzhxa,7626,nice textures and perfect exposure.
mdupwvzzcx,7627,the highlights are a bit blown out on this imho. would be a lot nice if they were toned down a touch.
0sl3davqxm,7628,way too much contrast and the higlits are absoulutely blown out.
fviryayayt,7629,really good concept.id like to see it a bit brighter with more contrast. then it would probably be a winner!
we466cp2ud,7630,those highlights are intense. think could have been better if toned down.
du919acb03,7631,not sure if the baddies will mark you down because of the colour tone !
pecqfq1qdb,7632,blurry and somewhat excessive on the processing.
4ln98iaykh,7633,this is not bw and hence dnmc

wr3hmtpx9w,7635,very nice use of contrast and shadows.
d6uodq4e5u,7636,not much of a portrait imho. and its way too dark.
4l3guwudf0,7637,what a beauty! nice coversion here. bet its great in color too!
f5v6dtddmd,7638,i like the split light effect . works well for this setup.
suauai58qd,7639,only marking it less than because of the inclusion of colour.
njembiovn8,7640,rather unsharp in my opinion
8ofyv5gt84,7641,"the light is nice, no harsh shadows or blown out highlights."
8ofyv5gt84,7642,"but you are missing so many tones of black and white in it, its mostly just grey. this is easily fixable with levels and curves in photoshop."
jeub5vn5r8,7643,"great grayscale tones, but a bit overdone on the smoothing effects. i like the vignetting."
pifmka554i,7644,excellent job. the softness is nice.
pifmka554i,7645,lovely soft light for those curves.
a9cdrg1qq0,7646,"though the color is lovely, the bw most certainly doesnt suck."

ydqaiur5a7,7651,old life that i remember well. nice use of light.
n9cxrmsyen,7652,interesting subjects. shadows are very dark on my screen which makes some of the darker objects outlines disappear.
o394feimyg,7653,"really nice bw, but i just cant get still life out of this."
w0xqx7jc3e,7654,very non dimensional.way to flat and straight needs to be more of a display with elevations
avnu3wymgz,7655,nice image the grapes are a little soft to me.
avnu3wymgz,7656,loving the elements here. nice sharpness and contrasts too. plus theres a glow.
qqenyareyy,7657,wonderful sharpness and glorious tones
05qcs7fsmr,7658,hmm. i kinda see the idea here but im not sure if it is well exceuted. is the grain feature purposely done? the textures in the two woods are awesome
mh7591tgmv,7659,i bet this is beautiful in color. great sharpness.
0089vib6jy,7660,"a great image imo, needs a little more sharpness."
rdg41fcfzv,7661,"this is really nice. great choice of elements, kind of whimsical, nice light and shadows. i hope this does well."
uv8ket7z17,7662,good idea and composition.lighting is a little flat
rpdnkup42x,7663,clever use of light. i like the solid light off of the facing flowers and the translucent light through the turned ones.
rpdnkup42x,7664,somethings interesting in how this is composed and how the stalks jut about towards the light
rpdnkup42x,7665,very nice use of light one of the few as i am making my intinal run through the thumbnails that jumped off the page at me!
c230ujqi7k,7666,to me the bw conversion is a bit flat in tone
2fauz7mp54,7667,"well lit, i like the minimal noise and grain in this photo."
bmy2ar3kia,7668,no way this can be considered still life but it is a pretty cool bw pic i give you points just for that
yy91ggwuib,7669,great processing. lovely tones and mood.
damarsbu3s,7670,nice setup. i wonder if this would have been stronger with a sepia tone.
mqfe147f5i,7671,love the stark darkness yet details of the flowers are preserved nicely
mqfe147f5i,7672,"nice, when harsh light works prefectly"
l5p1uwc0p1,7673,love the detail on the petals but im not so fond of the shadow and light.to me the light is very harsh
l5p1uwc0p1,7674,those are nice flowers. i wish you used softer light to accentuate the textures.
4k7aerwy8r,7675,"i find this almost uncomfortable to look at, very bright, and rather harsh. i find the foregroundbackground blend quite disorientating and adds to my visual discomfort. i am sure this will appeal to some, just not me."
ucmkot2nif,7676,i love the matte feel of this photo. excellent exposure. well done
ucmkot2nif,7677,"lovely comp. and processing, a classic example. nice how you grain without looking like noise just for the sake of it. great job!"
15v7hvmstu,7678,had to import this one on photoshop to find out what it was all about. not a bad picture but you were realy a little heavy handed on the black that day.
15v7hvmstu,7679,sorry possibilities here but much too dark for me
gvr2avqj91,7680,"pretty, but this seems mire like an underexposed portrait than a lowkey one. sorry."
xfwi934pej,7681,looks like locorice whips all twisted together. can see good detail in the shadow areas.
4liqzji4py,7682,i really like these dark tones and the subtle colors.
qfd51gvvf6,7683,i like this a lot very balanced light and dark halves of the photo
aor5fziv6y,7684,"fantastic work. oddly, the darkness doesnt add a dark feel to your communication."
aor5fziv6y,7685,"love this ideal, just a wonderful quality photo, highlights, contrast, sharpness are great,"
i4b0kur0fs,7686,"i feel that you missed the opportunity to explore the moodiness and darkness that a lowkey image could have produced, imo there are too many highlights, and not enough exploration of the darker tones. the glares dont work for me here. other than that, very arresting photo!"
4m3wbvf9t8,7687,"i am gonna have to say that this is a touch on the dark side.and yes my monitor is calibrated once a month. i can make out the texture alright, but it all comes across almost to blah."
d9z8szy7bu,7688,this is a bit too posterized for me. the image lacks a bit of atmosphere and detail.
okwl8aoc7v,7689,"yes, very clever! im not sure the darkness adds to the photo in terms of mood or effect, but you certainly communicate your visual pun very effectively."
bknzy5prfq,7690,good macro shot.good detail and texture!
qqsyeu9hqv,7691,just enought light to make the interesting. good job!
dj3qyl2q3n,7692,"bass, midrange and tweeter. a cool audio capture with the quiet power of bw"

b8kzkhtr84,7695,"great use of the relaxed rules neat,"
hrr40rigf6,7696,very nice pic.actually very dark. good representation
0s2mtk94mr,7697,"nicely soften image, you should have worked on showing off a little more these two weels as well."
zwtp9k8zef,7698,an interesting image however i feel there is too much white and red for this to be black on black. only my opinion. wish i had a chook to photograph
z0hblzfj7f,7699,"well, little to dark, but nice anyvay,"
mocdm0r5ro,7700,the lowkey processing transforms this image into something mysterious and fascinating.
oern6kkjc5,7701,"good ad, but need moer light , at least for my,"
jlqfck26sw,7702,would have been a cool picture if there was a little mroe light on him.
ygt04jm65e,7703,why is misty hazy at the bottom of the picture
kb9zp3va33,7704,"the light is too hard, and maybe you could try different light directions."
ngm3r5pfgu,7705,nice photo. the red begs for a different category than black on black.
ro6qehzbrc,7706,"interesting, but light is a bit flat for me."
8ws1jb3r1s,7707,beautiful dark black with a good drawing in the dark parts.
37pfrk78i6,7708,"unique and well executed. artlike, dark, gothic."

7ijy4hsncq,7711,like this very much. clean lines and perfect exposure.
gjza71o3aq,7712,lovely portrait! beautifully lit and nice detail.
hqm7faeivw,7713,"theres just a hint of color in there, isnt there?"
6rmhgwdm31,7714,"just too flat, tonaly, no black blacks or white whites."
6rmhgwdm31,7715,would have looked interesting with alot alot of contrast.
dl8trrlulc,7716,"really good use of black and white on this one, especially with that shadow."
dl8trrlulc,7717,"cool. if only a tad brighter love the texture, great job."
dl8trrlulc,7718,"the content of the photo isnt the most exciting, but the contrast of light and dark is very good."
gdaweyzv9r,7719,where is that stupid light switch?
gdaweyzv9r,7720,nice dark effect. what mood were you trying for?
5ttt72oa7h,7721,"well, she should be a model. you should do the cards models give to agencies. for a hint color is for models and bw is for actors."
vss9yetu0j,7722,"wow, very bold photograph, framed in a unique way. im going to give you !"
vss9yetu0j,7723,you cant getting anymore black and white nice conscept

wwxvlbn8w6,7727,good portrait. captures personality well. good exposure.
mq47fq50t6,7728,"good detail, nice tones. job well done."
e342au6rtj,7729,"hmm, all the elements of this photo work well in black and white, especially the bricks, but the way the photo is composed is a bit flat."
05so1xj02s,7730,you can feel the texture just looking at the photo. this is a very nice use of dark and light.
eza9ic5imu,7731,"darling, well done bw. good, good job. nice tone."
kq0nq8omj9,7732,"this looks like it was done in duotone i found that if you go by gordons tutorial but lighten the green a few shades, it makes a more pleasing bw. but i do like the stark contrasts you have here!"
kq0nq8omj9,7733,"pure black and white would have been better, this looks like a blurry image that was sharpened. great tone."
vcvkdr1nrj,7734,"nice sharp image, yet it seems too busy. personally i like brighter highlights."
ww36r30i8g,7735,interesting. it would work in color or b w.
f2g3h7qmoa,7736,"awesome. maybe a little sharper if possible. unless this is the effect you wanted, then keep it this way."
m9oxvcn7cq,7737,"this is very good. i love the texture, tone,works for me. well done, fine bw."

z43862ws68,7743,duh! its a roadking. i see that now. my husband has a r.k. classic.
eniwv7o7ez,7744,"excellent use of contrast, you unlike a lot of the others realize the purpose of black and white and know how to make it effective."
eniwv7o7ez,7745,"i like the contrast. is it resly a red peper, how did you get it to go so black?"
5tdm8f189k,7746,beautiful. but a bit too grey on my monitor. i love the curling of the petals.
5tdm8f189k,7747,wonderful. neat bw. good job.

0n2htdasaq,7749,"ahh, thats just what hes say too. how cute. neat bw. good job."
v5dsgrl37k,7750,ominious. but a little dark. i guess that was the effect you were looking for?
v5dsgrl37k,7751,"another one that is too dark for my tastes, i want to see more detail in the building that tells me why it is so special."
0q7i9xcy9j,7752,the disgusting wermies blend too much
0q7i9xcy9j,7753,"its almost too hard to see teh catepillars with all of the limbs. im not sure how you could correct that, but they kinda blend in with the branches."
0dwqgbaa0e,7754,shadow at the bottom distracts from the image.
doslh6ze3u,7755,"neat. i admit i dont know quite what it is, but i like the repeating patterns between the tilesstones? and the reflections."
et1vezcuyy,7756,nice use of shadow. and curves.
jr1owtqtmj,7757,parts look a little oversharpened to me.sometimes hard to predict how much the final jpeg compression will affect that.
f6a8dluckh,7758,"awesome, wish it wasnt taken through a screen or is this textured that way on purpose? great capture though!"
qjsaz6uzbd,7759,wow. the texture of the grandmothers hands is incredible. great contrast.
wopwke6qba,7760,is that line from douglas adams?
wopwke6qba,7761,cool idea tips of fiungers arent quite sharp enough.
xumaor4g1j,7762,nice contrast of lights and darks
xumaor4g1j,7763,graveyards always look fantastic in black n white. you captured it well.
77k6yk8d0p,7764,to much darkness and not enough contrast of lights and darks
rl0n65gauu,7765,great application of black and white.
rl0n65gauu,7766,the motif is fitting for the bw medium.
tzcveabr3c,7767,nice idea good choice for bw. i might have waited for more clouds in the openings in the trees.
tzcveabr3c,7768,its great when you look at a picture and get this feeling of vertigo. annida
wdhu42job1,7769,"looks like its sprung a leak. this kind of thing, imo, demands more contrast. id increase the density of the darks. nice."

bh8utuol4g,7771,great idea nice balance and contrast.
bh8utuol4g,7772,"as in yinyang? cool photo, like the contrast of the shiny black with the kind of blurred white. good idea."
pkbic0k067,7773,"this looks so pretty, i only wish it were in color. i think bw here doesnt help the picture but detracts from its beauty. of course, i had no opportunity to see it in color."
mhhgcgtzdc,7774,effective backlighting. very good job.
44clkinnfr,7775,"green? green isnt black and white, sorry."
44clkinnfr,7776,nice photo but stands out next to all the other thumdnails as not being bw.
vosmnj9x4a,7777,"very striking use of the colour inversion. i checked it with them the other way around, and it was a great photo that way too, but this makes it eerie and interesting."
vosmnj9x4a,7778,too bright with your inversion of colors.
dhtocze94m,7779,"another image with too much compression! the th one ive found. im sure others have said this, but compressing down to kb when you can use kb hurts your image quality. other than that, a nice photo."
dhtocze94m,7780,looks like the pedals have too much sharpness.
jbzozue3r3,7781,"took the image and put it on ps elementsgtauto levels. slightly darkened the image and improved what i think is a really nice photo. just a little too light, i think."

gak9n8tv64,7819,"awesome! id like to see this in color too. some acidic color, perhaps. ."
gak9n8tv64,7820,nice and artistic.good contrast. very interesting pace.
pt3cf8eu7m,7821,great mood and action snowflakes
yf71nykxy2,7822,"wonderful composition.sky may be a tad grainy, but this is a good one."
zoxlbykzp1,7823,its kind of hard to see the details of the roots. i think more contrast would have helped it out.
n91vvhj7ut,7824,"a bit more contrast. whites should be white, blacks should be black."
51liarcssu,7825,"ah, someone thought you a cheater. i must be rewarding to know that someone wasted their effort trying to get you disqualified. that said, i dont really enjoy flames or artistic depictions of them, and certainly not in bw."
xg1shqkfca,7826,"this is great, and excellent choice of sharpening and noise reduction. the tones are perfect."
dtkkxbj807,7827,"good job, the conversion and contrast work well here."
myftftew0q,7828,"nice dop, the last columns seems to blend together"
myftftew0q,7829,"this is awesome, love the way the light hits the cloumns. an added bonus would have been someones shadow cast in the formost beam."
1ue7uiwnxi,7830,"very nice use of shadow and lines, which is amplified by being black and white. i really like it."
d3pmc71tc6,7831,"great sot, i like the candid feel and this makes a great portrait. i can easily feel the warmth and intimacy here. ."
y8k4xakyk2,7832,quite gray feeling. i like it better if shes rotated degrees counterclockwise.
nqorfqe8nd,7833,a bit grainy for my taste. nice otherwise though.
dtmb6l873h,7834,"it looks good, nice border.its a little bit soft for my taste though"
fp7e3rosks,7835,this is a gorgeous portrait maybe just a tad oversharpened for my taste but still one of the best.
fp7e3rosks,7836,surely this is survivor amber? beautiful portrait great tonality
i67flfacj2,7837,great idea! but the image seems a bit grainy and blurry.
i67flfacj2,7838,"cool idea, i get it. the shadow looks a little bit dirty."
813ej3hwsv,7839,"great picture, but wish the whites were a little whiter. still, that seems like a minor detail considering how well everything else was executed ."
2cfvb01l2p,7840,fantastic texture in this photo. really excellent capture
2cfvb01l2p,7841,oh wow! is there a colored version?
2y7sta2zz1,7842,i can barely make out the image.terrible resolution.
2y7sta2zz1,7843,"hmm, not to sure bout this. very grainy intentional or not, very dark on the model and hard to distinguish.sorry.it doesnt work for me"
9h3hrw02ox,7844,"i love the feeling in this picture, not sure why great job, works very well in bw"
s39z4ubu9i,7845,"this is a nice picture, i like the arches. maybe a little more contrast would be give it a kick."
26o0pdepkc,7846,interesting. nice use of backlighting nad front bouncefill.
26o0pdepkc,7847,nice use of backlighting.it feels like i can reach out and actually touch this.good detail in the veins as well.
45aymncrse,7848,good portrait.nice work with light.
7rdrph5ft9,7849,i love the contrast on this one. powerfull
hw3295714y,7850,this image could use a little more contrast imho. the blacks to be real black.
9sghwzo6a3,7851,i can still smell them.nice detail and perceptable textures.
33w74pn8nm,7852,"you should have been making movies in germany in the s, thats impressive."
33w74pn8nm,7853,"excellent, this is a wonderful use of light and bw."
jja0sa1gy7,7854,cool deal.i like the blurred splash.
ffjkr3h65u,7855,nice contrast. really shows off the detail in the texture of the rocks.
ik9lnumx3r,7856,little dark on the tools as you cant tell where one begins and the other ends. nice idea though.
5vu3i7un0u,7857,"the texture here is outstanding, but nothing else interests me. good show."
p9f6y7rw8t,7858,great capture of grays and textures. a bit more contrast may have been very effective!
p9f6y7rw8t,7859,"excellent photo, the light and shadows are great."
v0j52d5fu5,7860,interesting.good composition.excellent tonality. i like this mucho!
l7qacwiiss,7861,this is very cute. a bit overexposed and soft though.
l7qacwiiss,7862,i like the light and texture on the jeans very much.
faybl4b79b,7863,very nice exposure. these are hard with so much contrast and you achieved it well
faybl4b79b,7864,good capture of lights. nice accent with dark parts.
u1e82zybyr,7865,very dark on my monitor? stars cool though
u1e82zybyr,7866,"i think this is a good idea, but it is a little too dark at least on my monitor"
b6fhjb2d48,7867,too much contrast for my taste.interesting lines.
05ylqmu0p8,7868,what a cool old place! it is nice to find a place like this but i feel you needed to use more of its natural surroundings and a bit more contrast.
ptdkrxb09x,7869,it looks so classic. if it werent for the sneakers with velcro youd think that this was years old.
wxr9dzsv84,7870,"black and white, not red and white please"
wxr9dzsv84,7871,kinda sepia but i like the fogginess.
vlfzk914j6,7872,great tones and a good image to use them on. i like the mood of the image.
r2iqbrk7o6,7873,nice lines and texture. a bit noisy though
r2iqbrk7o6,7874,"excellent study in light and shadows. the image suffers a bit from grain, but the over all effect is very powerful."
zl58u0twc8,7875,very cutenice sharp capture. but it looks a little on the gray sidedid you do levels on this?
w01l4heynm,7876,not enough contrast.mabey if he would have been wearing all white
w01l4heynm,7877,a little too flat and dark on my monitor.
fq48e1rby2,7878,nice contrast and tone. good setting as well.
a5j7vpbfty,7879,great contrast and interim tonality
frxir82e5f,7880,wow! what a capture and what a great choice for bw.
shtskzy0t3,7881,"perfect capture to be in black and white, my favourite"
24xshsz1yi,7882,this is showing signs of being handheld. just a touch of motion blurred softness.
asz16hnakz,7883,"wow! beautiful study in natural lines. the contrast is great, sharpenss and detail is excellent as well. excellent work!"
8jykr9p349,7884,"good photo, but it just seems to be missing something. maybe it would be better in color, i dont know."
xua76v00d2,7885,"some white, some black, and a whole lot of green."
xua76v00d2,7886,"i see black, i see white, but what is that brown color inbetween."
xhbgpas7ty,7887,the effect that you used seems to make the trees blend into the building.i dont like that loss of detail.
xhbgpas7ty,7888,i think the oversharpening made it look kind of unique.this is really cool and sort of cartoony in a way. d
d8ja6fmobg,7889,"this photograph is too dark, not enough detail in it, for me to figure it out. sorry."
6quyym3fa2,7890,the light is way too harsh and much detail is lost towards the bottom.
m7bveco6n7,7891,need just a little darker contrast i think.
dho2hxzbs4,7892,well done for seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary. how many shoes has my growing daughter gone through like this! only crit. is perhaps its alittle too light
uzh5iiuasw,7893,"theres a lot of noise in there. have you tried running your photos through neatimage or helicon noise filter? they are both free and easy to use, and help with that grainy apearance.unless that is what you wanted in there if that is the case, then good job!"
1bybnby56x,7894,"whats not to love here.them cows are perfect for black and white, huh? very interesting lines running everywhere."
0ui8xj2aox,7895,this is very dark and flat looking. i needs some levels and contrast adjustments.
0ui8xj2aox,7896,underexposed in my opinion. with this kind of light it doesnt really give the feeling of winter too much. maybe a bit brighter next time.
zh2cnpmekj,7897,love the capture of movement in this well composed and excellently lit image
qanc00iv9i,7898,"poor quality, not enough info here."
qanc00iv9i,7899,"i dont like to say lofi is bad, and ive seen examples of great lofi, this isnt it. its not gritty enough to be gritty, and its not sharp enough to know what it is, . its a nice attempt, but needs more bold steps one way or the other."
fqoz9g1v44,7900,the detail is great. but the complexity is giving me a headache.
fqoz9g1v44,7901,so very cool an awesome picture. would like to see it in bw instead of the browntone.
1u7ttwcjuc,7902,nice.a bit dark. maybe a bit stronger contrast would boost it.
1u7ttwcjuc,7903,"scarry, cool but i would like to have seen some more definition in the leaves too dark"
1u7ttwcjuc,7904,"in my opinion the foto is too dark, if it wasnt for that it would be a great photo."
o26xemddub,7905,brilliant use of light and dark contrast.
emjjytcqw5,7906,good contrast and shadow. missing life tho
drcheqkw9r,7907,"too busy, i think the statues shadow is too much."
pa81jaam3r,7908,the pose is a little contrived and there is a lot of noise
ljw1bft9ky,7909,a bit too much exposure on the lights for me. probably difficult to balance much better than you did though.
ljw1bft9ky,7910,love the textures and the light the bottom step is a bit confusing visually for me
5i6t1ze0xj,7911,"neat, but i have the feeling that somethin is missin, a photo with great potential though"
fg9ja15jqy,7912,this is nice. very nice. its a little offkilter and i think i like that very good bw conversion given the limited basic editing rules. good find.
6iu29sbkmg,7913,very original. i like the message. lol. the shadow gives an extra feel to the photo.
6iu29sbkmg,7914,what a nice idea. perhaps a frontal light would have created more contrast in the reflections.
skee0iv7cc,7915,very flat looking. maybe some levels and contrast adjustments would help
joy4kbwkqh,7916,nice how clouds shapes are repeated on bottom. too dark on shadows.
o1rr5cp8m1,7917,th bottom lightness bothers me and i would prefer it darker but then i like a lot of contrast in my monos
78s7edy4nv,7918,this is really sharp and well composed. it looks just a little muddy to me though. maybe a little more levelscontrast adjustment to make it pop
7qw6adbcur,7919,cool! i bet that if you covered the opening to the light your shadows would hvae came out even stonger
9o3z4rk9wv,7920,very interesting treatment. i think i like it. the limited number of colorsgrays in this case make for a desolate mood.
farqcqbpab,7921,effectively dark and dismal. good job.
farqcqbpab,7922,"there will be the sweetness and light brigade who will insist you brighten this image. do not listen. this is a great photo and reminds me of everything from james bond to the matrix. you did a fine job, friend."
farqcqbpab,7923,it looks a little muddy maybe some levels and contrast adjustment. i do like your effort though.
bkofkrngoi,7924,great use of texture and light.
z9vf4nf3oe,7925,"grr! nice exposure, kudos on not overexposing the buckle."
6alpz36b2p,7926,"nice photo but it looks really soft, unsharpened. too much neat image?"
rjrybe9ud7,7927,"maybe the trash noise fits this one, but still, i dont like it."
s52r2hfvq2,7928,"uhh good black white macro dude, sharp"
s52r2hfvq2,7929,very nice. i hope my will help offset the cathaters! bol
4otgf5ta20,7930,the dark is too dark for me. i wouldh have liked to have seen a little detail in the shadows.
7l3wnz5czi,7931,"comp is nice, it seems like i can almost feel the texture of the petals"
5nswsjx7uy,7932,"ool image, i like the bw tones and the smoothness of this image."
f7bpjtc53d,7933,"interesting contrasts, life in bw"
f7bpjtc53d,7934,"i think this is a great use of elements. personally, its a little too contrasty for my tastes as i would have liked to have seen more detail in the silhouettes."
v7ma7hjia1,7935,for a first kiss there sure isnt any trepidation here! the tones are pretty flat.
3u0k6ugj84,7936,"good picture. a bit spacy and would have enjoyed it sharper, but nice job"
d46zeygvy8,7937,"dark and moody, my type of bw"
7wnfgbm4e5,7938,"cool macro, nice variation of light and shadow."
l54b2vdiya,7939,the cosmis effect is a bit too much for me. too much detail blown out.
yo9qnzrd6c,7940,an example of balance for those entrants who choose trendy offbalance.
7fvq5s4f54,7941,"curving lines are pleasant to look at and i like the way you framed it. a little to much contrast, imo. there are hardly any midtones in the picture. but that is only my opinion."
qjfw0eima1,7942,"too dark to really make out any details and while that is sometimes a good thing, in this case imo it is not. maybe this was intentional and then i just dont get it perhaps but if not you should check out your monitor."
p6vnd4lp04,7943,"great use of shadow. crappy model , . b robert"
bg10ffb68t,7944,"awesome picture, i love the light coming through the trees. too bad it is so noisy."
5rsk9vegkv,7945,"looks a little flat, maybe a little more contrast adjustment to make it pop."
g323m92036,7946,study in light andpatterns. not terribily interesting.
gb7frxveuk,7947,this is really interesting! the angles and shadows create an interesting mood.
qyeqgmksvc,7948,its not a silhouettemore backlighting would have solved that
7l3680srla,7949,very sweet portrait of your best friend. white is a bit blown on his forhead but otherwise this is perfect.
3tnqu9cd5t,7950,"poor quality, little effort. try harder next time."
qy1cionnz2,7951,"this works well in bw. excellent contrast, detail, with minimal blown highlights."
9l8tt9dyq6,7952,"breathtaking photograph, it really shows age and beauty. i did find the clouds a little grainy noise, but thats just a minor detail."
ygiecibm52,7953,"a bit too much contrast for my taste, gives it a flat feeling."
we4acojx1p,7954,i think a little levels and constrast work would help this flat looking image.
xvphyuij20,7955,like the lines in the foreground.maybe could use a lil more contrast though.still i like a lot. .
dqw703s1y2,7956,a bit gray and nothing sharp.
dqw703s1y2,7957,impressive and honest bw. great work
dzqkt54ybs,7958,"your picture is nice and clear. however, it isnt really the sort of picture that is better in black and white than in color."
zpx8i6g7ih,7959,"i can see that the softness is from a filter effect. imo, it doesnt add to the picture. usually with something this delicate, i like to see all the details. only my personal opinion."
g6wt0he9in,7960,"i think this could be a great image, but this version seems a bit overprocessed."
g6wt0he9in,7961,this is surreal in its clarity and contrasts of light and dark. the clouds are stunning. .
otn5jr9bwg,7962,nice white and darks and great patterns!
e5mfjvnl9r,7963,"nice reflections, great contrast, tone, and detail."
xlsigaosje,7964,a little blurry. is it a picture of a ghost?
dbezgcjo5r,7965,certainly a cutie and very well exposed with good texture and great bw study. bumping yo
0ojhlz1nrp,7966,this looked alot better in color on photosig.com
ir6z8u295u,7967,one of moust artistic captures. i like color version pretty much aswell.
6k72nvroh5,7968,"im my rememberence, infared has a little deeper detail then that i could be wrong though, but i like the idea."
wumzecbhid,7969,"unfortuanately, there seems to have been some jpeg compression issues on this photograph. there are noticeable jpeg artifacts that could have been dealt with by a more effecient way to export your photographs. as for the photograph itself very natural and well composed."
2vllvas6yp,7970,its a winner to me. incredible atmosphere. .
2vllvas6yp,7971,"so lovely to look at, very calm and peaceful, added to faves. but not black and white."
y563m2962r,7972,"i guess you forgot to take out all the color? too bad, because this would be a great image. maybe youll revisit it without the constraints of basic editing?"
y563m2962r,7973,"is it, though? appears rather gray to me. traffic jams are like bad movies just when you think theyre over."
y563m2962r,7974,not true black and white. there are still color components in this photo. would have been better if you converted to greyscale.
xsgzo2vj3z,7975,"this could stand to use just a little adjustment on the levels, getting the whites all the way to full white."
bb8ij0r88m,7976,finally some nice tones! great texture on the jackets too. great portrait. well done.
uzplvhi8jd,7977,"for statuessculputes check or czech out the work of jozef sudek. more shadows on the sculpure itself would add more life and texture and interest to it, bit flat as it is."
7r8kf8nl53,7978,great feel to it. excellent black and white.
7r8kf8nl53,7979,"i picture this with something i normally hate, alot of grain. sort of reminded me of night of the living dead."
0bihubeyee,7980,i guess it could be my screen but it seems to have a very slight bluish cast.
0bihubeyee,7981,an interesting study in the physics of light works well in black and white. great photo!
0bihubeyee,7982,"true the colors are black and white, but looks like a color photo"
0bihubeyee,7983,"very nicely done, it looks to me like this was not shifted all the way to bw, just mostly desat? anyhow, ."
0bihubeyee,7984,yes! i love that inner image wow! i think it could have been improved with a little more contrast hope you do well
0bihubeyee,7985,"i know its argueable, buts not really black and white. and its been seen recently done many times. so those will cost you a bit."
0bihubeyee,7986,"the image looks a little dark, could do with some levels or curves adjustment."
u6wmbjndw5,7987,"idyllic. very peaceful, detailed, sharp, great tones."
09jvpxp0sb,7988,maybe neat image or diff. iso setting
9mg2g4p1ym,7989,"im sure ive seen this model before, he is certainly very photogenic. excellent bw."
4xnnwpybp5,7990,very nice clarity and contrast gl
kjwnss7d19,7991,beautiful contrast between lights and darks makes the picture stand out.
7h57km3h7u,7992,"great image, the grain adds to the whole feel of the image."
vqligvptrt,7993,"nice, nice! i would think the color version would make a good poster. even in black and white it looks tropical."
a1qcmzk3o1,7994,i like the darkness and the texture. very scratchy.
a1qcmzk3o1,7995,"whoa. seems a bit oversharpened or something. its an interesting effect, though"
uikokep3im,7996,very nice detail on the grackle.
baotxc6gf9,7997,i love warm and fuxxy images.
baotxc6gf9,7998,"you get an for being so weird and grainy. ironically, it is the murder itself that seems like a dream."
baotxc6gf9,7999,its grainy. good idea for a picture though.
7h69twehlt,8000,extraordinary! great use of blur.
jwe2tvo5e2,8001,the blown highlights add a poignancy to this. the light seems like a beautiful burden she must carry.
zx13ylhpz2,8002,"this is not bw, a good image tho"
zx13ylhpz2,8003,the mood of the picutre is great. there are some areas of the photo that a bit more contrast would have helped
ps53jfholu,8004,"the sharpness and clarety ,the sky,its got it all.one for my favourites."
ps53jfholu,8005,"not bad, maybe a little to much tonemapping, but otherwise good."
ps53jfholu,8006,"hdr is really hip now and you are very close to have overdone it i think, but luckily enough you didnt and its a great picture."
ps53jfholu,8007,nice tones. it looks like bw hdr to me. .
ed60bb3kdd,8008,nice phtograph. i like the leading line and soft light.
ed60bb3kdd,8009,"a great shot.perspective, light and interest.nicely done!"
fisv3obg5f,8010,"very nice, only time i remember power lines used effectively. great bw conversion too."
knxaebsgwi,8011,oreo.so american.well to me it is. i love the highkey light here. nice job.
tu6krgyhqr,8012,"i love the whay the structures photographed. the person in the photo is a distraction, to me."
4u3lwd696o,8013,interesting light progression in this one.
x3r7wfnmx7,8014,wow! those clouds are gorgeous. great contrast.
4kvxxxm4jd,8015,i like the clarity. could use a bit of a contrast boost.
x6lk6oukz7,8016,hey. . .thats not black and white. i see red lips and fleshtoned ears. hmm. interesting photo tho for sure.
abqgauph6a,8017,"amazing effect, the transparency of the wings. breathtaking."
9dfzxr6oov,8018,"glorious. this is so powerfully moody, with the silvery, smooth tones. beautiful!"
yn510wa7ku,8019,this image seems oversharpened or something. the are too many tiny elements in this image that do not lend themselves to a bw treatment.
o7g8bi1nge,8020,adorable! i like the black backgroundit adds to the photo and makes the white stand out more.
r1tai6bjpp,8021,difficult to know what to say about this one. dark and sombre and quite difficult to look at and to understand.
8efpktm7c2,8022,would of liked to have seen slightly more contrast in this! cute pic!
x3tns5ndnn,8023,i love the lines and angles here. this is a great lonely photo. the contrast is wonderful. .
x3tns5ndnn,8024,imho this needs a big boost in contrast to really make it pop .
48wov5gl24,8025,this photo is full of drama! the beautiful light with the stark black trees. .
9qvbfxbrlv,8026,wow. this is absolutely amazing. i love the effect on the clouds. definitely deserving of the blue. although months ago.
9qvbfxbrlv,8027,amazing shot.worthy of the blue!
9qvbfxbrlv,8028,great job dodging and burning here. magical image. i just thought better contrast would of made this really superb.
9qvbfxbrlv,8029,this isnt really black white. its gotta be blue or red!
9qvbfxbrlv,8030,amazing sky.would love to have seen this in colour! wow.great image
tgr57tqt2z,8031,great textures on this photo the bw really bring them out
gotlvw1h5r,8032,"oh, i love this one! the amazing precision of those marchers and their rifles gives such a noble feel to the photo. excellent choice for a black and white photo it adds even more drama!"
6qo6hbdc93,8033,"love the soft feel you have created with this, soft but detailed at the same time. very nice, great contrast here as well."
yb2fmbb0tq,8034,great use of dodging and burning to bring out a ton of detail!
p55wycmiwp,8035,"seems a wee bit dark, some additional highlights and white would help balance this more, for me. gl"
c1cjr15kxf,8036,very nice idea. storms coming?lol. id like to see tad more selective color to darken the blacks and perhaps eliminate some of the black tone in whites. gl
e59u74ttka,8037,good capture! nice darks and lights. would have liked to see more detail in the feathers.
mneaol6g91,8038,nice photo. great detail light.
6tmiw0seip,8039,"something nostalgic and sad about this image, the memories of childhood come flooding in. i like the texture specially in the cardigan."
ib07i4p227,8040,wow. is it actually an hour exposure?
tay743pwh0,8041,great job. i like the way that there are two shades. very light and very dark.
syu9kygcly,8042,nice capture of motion in this image
blumnqarsy,8043,"very nice, thought first some whites would be nice in there but with the shadow play there is no need.like it!"
blumnqarsy,8044,"great detail, light and contrast.great as a b and w"
qr97hh0ilr,8045,this photo is both deeply touching and well photographed with a beautiful use of light to create the mood of this image. .
tn6mateggu,8046,omg shes beautiful and the bw just makes the image even more stunning.gl
w80wzlxs8z,8047,"nice texture, possibly lost a little detail in the shadows"
ajke619t6f,8048,"very cool and imaginative. wish the black was a little blacker, but good photo nonetheless."
33fp8jxqo4,8049,"cutepose, but a bit blurry and highlights blown out."
33fp8jxqo4,8050,quite blurry and the highlights are way blown out . sorry .
qjjuj19u6u,8051,it looks quite oversharpened i think and unless its my monitor the highlights seem to burn out.
yrkxrxr5xk,8052,lovely bw artistic study.
33ardgzlml,8053,lacks sharpness and clarity. its also quite noisey
0axak0tkd1,8054,"great capture of the clouds, would have like to have seen more contrast but still a very nice capture."
3c31umupsc,8055,"perfect.actually, awesome image in black white."
0qjgkmh9j3,8056,". and th? you was robbed! seriously, though, i really dont get this result it is such a classic black and white and would make a superb print."
n4xsx14wq2,8057,this is great in bw. my imagination tells me its stunning in colour to.
n4xsx14wq2,8058,incredible fine detail and tonality make this a great image.
mdwto741d7,8059,this definately suits being in black white.
4j28c6184t,8060,nice and very interesing image. lots of old detail.

ydb7eg0y3u,8074,"sharp, good contrast, good highlights. like it."
ez863lac3y,8075,cute idea. i think the pic looks too grey for me perhaps by fiddling with the levels or contrast you could have improved this?
c5626tnmzg,8076,impressive amount of nothingness.
5zmh2gfp2w,8077,beautyful picture! great capture! sharp and the light is perfect! from me
7qv07wkyzc,8078,nice contrast and interesting expressions on both models faces.

gtkcuyatui,8080,love the dreamy quality thats been created in this image!
c8d383alze,8081,"beautiful job. my only nitpick is that it is a little contrasty, the stem is jagged. other than that it is flawless."

5hvfrdwkcd,8083,beautyful picture! fantastic light and contrast!
03hgnq4mgk,8084,nice capture. the light quality is very nice.
l90kkr5efe,8085,this is stunning. i love the diatonal rays and the softness of the misty light. well done.
0z95y5osp0,8086,"just ok, this is a typical bw photo, kind of textbookish"
snjidfvk53,8087,well composed. nice use of those blinds and natural light to set off an interesting bw image. smooth and subtle.
01e4aabdx8,8088,"i like how the white line cordons it off, as well."
01e4aabdx8,8089,i think a good observation and super good bw canned nik though it may be it has a special look. v
o2bvhs172t,8090,red and white and blue and white and blue and black and white. feels like youre making a statement here. one could read a lot into this. a seven for you.

o4zywer2up,8099,reminds me of the place i got a flat tire.
jo43bbr3t4,8100,beautiful midkey processing. no contrast necessary.
zq561son5d,8101,"hmm.a little too dark, i cant quite make out the details, so im not really interested. sorry."
wtkw8tpbcz,8102,i had understood i was looking for an exposure of s. this one appears to be just s. very misleading im sure id have found it had it not been for that disgraceful deception.
wtkw8tpbcz,8103,"nice photo, but its not to much grey, more sepia."
vszzgz4te3,8104,"if you are experimenting with bw, it would be a good idea to explore light, shadow, tonality, texture and contrast."
y8wv2wiqrr,8105,the shades of gray are fantastic
5fy1gczqmg,8106,this is an amazing exposure. cant wait to see how you did it!
5fy1gczqmg,8107,oh i like this a lot. something about the blurred bodies with their grounded feet. kind of symbolic in a way.
gh8b7agndd,8108,"austere, cold, and perfect in bw."
0dtudyhtm9,8109,its not really black and white but monochrome.
0dtudyhtm9,8110,"this looks like some fancy sep work here, or at least something im unable to replicate. excellent tones and light values throughout. makes the image. nice."
h4dgcl76g8,8111,"its a pity you underexposed! yes, its still a good image, but it could be much better."
so6sirk3vz,8112,really nice colection of lines and shapes. works quite well in bw.

x186rm6n2v,8116,this sort of image just sings to my heart. love the crosshatching in the trees and the blur.
vw1djzo1g1,8117,"lovely, i like the bending light and the abstractness. it makes me not want to know how you did it to keep the magic."
vw1djzo1g1,8118,"gorgeous image, excellent manipulation of light and done."
fkzq8x1zef,8119,you got your and change. and here you said you dont know a thing about bw. this is very masterful! the detail is exquisite!
x69s6orbo2,8120,funny dude. wrong uniform though!
htqym4nsrb,8121,the blur and light could not be better. excellent
4s7xf6stlz,8122,almost looks like a negative or as if some some special filter was used. nice effect.
eldxuftewt,8123,"so many birds this month, which is a burden. i like the stark, graphic quality."
y87y5i7lxx,8124,black and white transforms this in an unexpected way. interesting.
y87y5i7lxx,8125,"stunning, love the grainy b.ground."
2mu8e78s9w,8126,i like how the black and white has turned the blue skies with wispy clouds into something with more character.

9jz75c25vd,8132,quite bucolic your place. great in bw
49f3dggm75,8133,"black and white shows us things here that a color image never could. the stripes, of course. the inky, imperfect lines. the freckles and smears. perfect."
l0tpivt7s3,8134,oh how cool ! the technical things couldnt be better. the beauty of the light against dark is wonderful ! great contrast. this has such a artsy feel to it and its just superb ! shiizzam
fqb2i1579b,8135,"nice photo, wish the jpg artifact was less noticeable."
nyou2ytfk5,8136,ok. what does this have to do with blue. nice capture though.
nyou2ytfk5,8137,"maybe this doesnt bring to mind the word blue, but nice picture anyway."
l2lcz663b9,8138,if she is my screen tft or i it had not been liked more contrasted. even so i like this degradation of blue
odw5hsrjzn,8139,"i see the blue, but the subjects are just soo happy. i would like the image even more if it were just a little bit sharper."
qjp4wuef2y,8140,i really dont know what to think of this. ive got to know how you did this. this is so unique and interesting. the photo is technically good. a great photo but whatever you did .ive just never seen anything like this. great job. ptl
qjp4wuef2y,8141,too many colors with the blue. nothing is dominant
p4zkh3mnqd,8142,just another blue jeans ad.
ymfpjn45w8,8143,"the blue in this pic is too saturated, too close to bw but an excellent picture regardless."
gyuyhxdzh3,8144,but the colors look unnatural noise or oversharpening and i dont like the way the light drops of in the corners.
ndw7t4xo7f,8145,initial response waow. really appealing . blue . really greta picture
ndw7t4xo7f,8146,"impressive, though a bit grainy. if the color was smooth it would look a lot better."

h1549jfalg,8149,awesome photo the colors are great and really pop!

h1549jfalg,8152,"the main feature of the picture is yellow, but i like the use of blue. really nice picture."
zajjl3vqcu,8153,"color the colors are vibrant blue, very pretty, and you caught them pretty well."
zajjl3vqcu,8154,"silly putty? lol neat idea, and fantastic blue. justine"
zajjl3vqcu,8155,cute but too much blue in my oppinion.
l0hc5tg5e3,8156,"postprocessing i might have boosted the saturation a little to make it stand out a bit more, or even darkened it a little to make it a bit more dramatic, but really doesnt need anything done to it."
g30w0cft1u,8157,"lol great idea for illusion! ya almost had me! o good use of the blur, i think the blur helps the effect here."
40nz0osjvf,8158,hmm. looks like blue cabana green cabana green cabana.closer to the blues one.
l5ikijh2tl,8159,a little purple but i bet it looked more blue in person!
s54d2cu06q,8160,the light looks like it needs to be a bit dimmer. or perhaps use a shorter exposure
8oujn6vd2k,8161,looks more sleepy than blue imo. nice portrait though.
8oujn6vd2k,8162,not bad. light is a little harsh.
q1pcaitawd,8163,too obvious an attempt for blue and rather boring.
xqvz4c4650,8164,too much contrast between blue and neutral leaves.
xqvz4c4650,8165,"wow nice color, texture, very nice"
fzqzmu2159,8166,nice idea. would have deserved a more subtle treatment of contrast and saturation
fzqzmu2159,8167,"very festive and a very good photo. i wish the blue were a little brighter, but its truly a great pic."
xy4cagalts,8168,i like this a lotslightly mysterious and quite witty good job
gokbk3zz0h,8169,"i would guess very little has been done to this, it certainly doesnt look over processed and i cant see any compression artifacts."
63ls9stcvk,8170,little dark on bottom but still a great pic
edridrmvb0,8171,"shame about the shadow, spoils an otherwise good image."
rjxr93ua9k,8172,"this has everything just as it should be ! i love the contrast, the curves, the nice blue color, the framecrop.its beautiful ! shiizzam"
0dx8bqf4v2,8173,the use of black and white here doesnt work for me. a nice pic though
0dx8bqf4v2,8174,definately evocative of the colour blue.
0dx8bqf4v2,8175,"with the coloring of this photo, the blueberries look more like tiny chestnuts. i love black and white, but this photo would have been better in color."
0dx8bqf4v2,8176,"in this case, id prefer to see the blue of the berries."
0dx8bqf4v2,8177,the color is a little too subdued. i do like the content of this photo a lot.
rtk6hbj6ju,8178,"when i checked some of the brightlylit berries in photoshop the densitometry indicated a pretty pure blue, although im sure theres a lot of purple ones too."
rtk6hbj6ju,8179,i really dont think or feel blue with this picture. the berries appear to be very purple to me.
05a4jpf4db,8180,"not even partly sure what im seeing here. and there are a lot of hot spots which are bothersome. i like the different blues, but i feel they could have been photographed differently for a more effective picture."
aeeelrwy24,8181,nice pic. its a shame the trees are not a litlle sharper.
2cskb0vajz,8182,very neat. i love the feeling of this picture. jacko
c5cxid7dle,8183,"digital processing very nice, image is free of artifacts and jaggies. coloring is great."
c5cxid7dle,8184,as an old model and soaring enthusiast i have to like this very blue image!
nchdu2jpwf,8185,great saturation job. really highlights the blue. jacko
qdf0h3q8xw,8186,"more grey than blue, but a nice picture."
qdf0h3q8xw,8187,not quite blue enough. nice photo though marksimms
sxa8h46r51,8188,"nicely done. good light, color.love the action. justine"
sxa8h46r51,8189,"great photo, makes me think of white, or black if anything."
m5dv3i5ugc,8190,this photo reminds me of a bedspread for some reason. i like the colors. very nice
m5dv3i5ugc,8191,"a bit too washed out at the bottom. nice shades of blue, though."
ek6onpwj5z,8192,red white and yes blue. give me more blue! the red shares too much dominance in the photo
jn7iycqzmu,8193,fun picture! i would have tried to get the full shadow of the capital g if possible.
jn7iycqzmu,8194,wow! great color! very nice photo. great clouds. swash
jn7iycqzmu,8195,i really like the vivid colors in this photo. great job. tomlw.
jn7iycqzmu,8196,"fantastic. i wish the from california was lit a little bit more.maybe you could do that with levels? not to worry, like this, the colors are wild and wonderful. neat capture. justine"
kmch2at4s3,8197,quality of the colors and capture of the details is awesome.another great photo.
p9iuzr5cry,8198,compression is good no jpeg artifacts
p9iuzr5cry,8199,great color and variation of blue!
hc6s19rrkv,8200,"i cant really make any suggestions on how to improve this particular image. the sharpness could possibly be increased a little, but other than that, i dont see anything else that would be an improvment."
pzmvd0hxpw,8201,very nice. gotta tell us how you did this. not nuff blue.
pzmvd0hxpw,8202,good designgood claritygood exposure striking picture
pzmvd0hxpw,8203,"cool setup here. nice color, a great classic optical illusion."
pzmvd0hxpw,8204,"hey cool foto, great colors . you got a ."
pzmvd0hxpw,8205,gorgeous color contrast. this is a really outstanding photo!
n5ejt5d8c3,8206,"jennifer looks very warm. interesting idea, worth a few extra points."
pkq3nvotl6,8207,"nice pic. you should try desaturating all colours except for blue and cyan maybe thats what you did, i dunno. i like it. jacko"
pkq3nvotl6,8208,the blue tint everywhere kinda ruins this picture. nothing you could do however.
u842xq7xef,8209,i really like this photo! it makes me think of the movie powers of . the slightly tangled quality of the stars makes it all the more interesting.
xsqipf41mq,8210,digital processing technical looks a little noisy and maybe oversharpen a little.
uq2h4jysyg,8211,"unless you mean jesus is blue cause hes dying for our sins, i dont see too much blue in here."
osx2y9b318,8212,"technical well executed. if you used a flash, you used it well, because you dont get the usual coloration etc."
qlg3s94grc,8213,digital processing good compression on this. no artifacts or anything like that. saturation is good.
qlg3s94grc,8214,the illumination on the plants is great! very good photo!
4b4r2jvgdb,8215,compression is good no jpeg artifacts
yggp5xxunf,8216,"after an hour of viewing oversaturated blue pics, this is refreshing. if i had started with this one, i would have asked you if you were colorblind."
yggp5xxunf,8217,"the image seems to be a bit boring. there is a lot of pixelation, and at first glance.i dont see or feel blue"
rsrba2bp8s,8218,the light is too sharp. way too charp.
rsrba2bp8s,8219,excellent shot.great use of blue and well composed
k4rpykflc7,8220,this is a well portrayed lonely blue photo.well composed
k4rpykflc7,8221,not sure what this has to do with blue other than the blue jeans.
yq3cthb6ci,8222,cool take on this idea. and all blue. good capture
9itd34xjik,8223,"beautiful portrait and lots of blue, beautiful blue. great job. ptl"
bnael6t55r,8224,"very eloquent ,well composed photo.especially in black and white."
bnael6t55r,8225,"i absolutely love everything about this photo. there is not a stich of blue in the photo, yet i feel blue all over when i look at it. great job.you get a from me."
r8rutizihs,8226,good color saturationexcellent exposuregood graphic impact
3yf8a06e1c,8227,"anyway, while i like the effect in in general, the blue is a bit too much blue for my taste. it looks too unnatural and like you played too much with your image editor. i would like it better if it would be a more faint colour tone."
3yf8a06e1c,8228,black light. why grainy. i like the picture though.
rg8enp0i6c,8229,"i have not idea what im looking at, but i really like the sharpness of the picture. good job. jacko"
rg8enp0i6c,8230,"great idea, slightly underexposed. marksimms"
xe60aeg1s7,8231,neat pictrure. very original.
lrf9jah8pe,8232,"digital processing again, perhaps a little additional sharpness perhaps not."
vau4gq8n86,8233,blue tubes. the men are lurking.
jdiba3xl4u,8234,"great photo, really nice detail. i like the way youve desaturated all the channels but blue. this really stands out as a great photo."
e7u7i4go91,8235,nice effect. really warm feeling. jacko
3pq2yufciv,8236,"kind of looks more like into the grey, but you took a really great photo. tomlw."
3pq2yufciv,8237,nice picture but invokes more of a grey feel than a blue one.
62qd8w73bk,8238,nice work. i love how the light sparkles! cub
62qd8w73bk,8239,great clarity and good reflections on the inklovely compositionand good colour well done
62qd8w73bk,8240,great photo. magnificent color of blue. i love the light reflections. without the shadow although i dont know how you would have gotten rid of it its a . even with its a . great photo.
upa3ilhj0b,8241,you could maybe have used a bit of neatimage to get rid of the grain.
sh386ey373,8242,. to replace color increase of the luminosity.
fi4v9p7q74,8243,digital processing maybe lighten the trees a tad.
tu1zx7e3gv,8244,but i cant see the pills colors? im going to die!
tu1zx7e3gv,8245,pretty good but you should have kept the color of the blue pills.
tu1zx7e3gv,8246,i think that this photo would have worked better if you were able to bring out the blue in only the blue pills against the black and white.
tu1zx7e3gv,8247,i dont get it. why did you choose black and white for this? sorry. its very nicely composed though. but the contrast looks a little off for black and white.
p2qnurtzo6,8248,"a bit hazy, but that adds to the mysticaldivine fuji."
p2qnurtzo6,8249,"this must be somewhere close to me.pnw? its really nice, you got the color so perfect. great capture. justine"
9tyclijpo2,8250,"haha at first glance i thought that you were referring to a good bit of sex to lighten the mood, then i realized that you might just mean the act of taking off the pants."
qa0x6p40k1,8251,a little less exposure and itd be much better.
qa0x6p40k1,8252,"outstanding picture, it doesnt feel as blue as some of the others ive seen though. still excellent photo."
z319zdkqn8,8253,i dont know about anyone else. christmas is blue for me.
lplqntizqs,8254,"would be great for the motion contest, too! good dynamics."
lplqntizqs,8255,amazing motion effect! blue in action!
opak142o0w,8256,"some will say the white is to washed out, but i think that some photos are allowed artistic license, and i feel you did a good job here."
xsgxkrldt2,8257,nice placement and color but would have liked a little more red in the accessories.
bte5livg7w,8258,i love the mood of this picture. great job!
zycrwx2k39,8259,"technically everything seems to be in order.focus is good, exposure is very fine with good detail where needed."
qm25yoijlm,8260,nice use of shadows. just not jumpin out at you appealling. just unique. good photo. ptl
x5cu5ck9t2,8261,i love the curves in this pic. looks a bit grainy. might only be my monitor. jacko
7j6djyppo6,8262,"agh! how does everyone do this legally! very cute, looks a little grainy though."
7j6djyppo6,8263,i go with an on this one because i love desaturation shots. marksimms
2kwnru7tap,8264,nothing blue of is this grey blue?
g0i5q00kpx,8265,wow this photo is jammed with colour and excitment i personally love itstunninganz
zi6jq6wddf,8266,processing a little more saturation on the blues would help a little. there is nothing that really needs to be done to this though.
f8tulhihff,8267,"color the color is interesting, rather bland though."
f8tulhihff,8268,i see a whole lot more green than blue.
iq69ponjuw,8269,hmm. the light is just way too harsh
oxl9mvklko,8270,spooky. i like it. the red adds a nice touch. jacko.
4o15o4cgzi,8271,"definetly makes one think of blue, therefore meets criteria. shakey looking."
rbu5g5cj57,8272,nice shades of blue. a little unsharp though.
wnlgcwtk75,8273,i think the light is a little harsh and will try and remember to diffuse the light source next time.
wnlgcwtk75,8274,i love the balance this has. the blue shadow really adds a lot to this. wonderful use of thirds ! shiizzam
wnlgcwtk75,8275,nice use of the refracting light
lq7v3kgp7v,8276,"i think if, in editing, you had increased the saturation and contrast this would be much more dramatic. and more blue."
q5yp5k7o2s,8277,great stopmotion with great texture.
7e45bdevju,8278,"fun photo. black is too grey, though."
7e45bdevju,8279,nice touch.i thought that someone would do blue from blues clues

t3hv0bxntf,8285,blue in colour and mood nice.
9qvikv0p7u,8286,"this is wonderful! an excellent choice of blue. youll do well, im sure."
jz9uc55b2t,8287,isnt it yellow and blue make green?
jz9uc55b2t,8288,a little too much saturation for my taste.
jz9uc55b2t,8289,i always thought yellow minus green makes blue!
hei5op5moy,8290,"looks pretty green to me. and the name makes me think of a deep dark black whole. interesting idea, but nothing is really clear here."
hei5op5moy,8291,"i like the ripple effect, but the photo is a little too obscure."
hei5op5moy,8292,"pretty just looks a little empty. the color, mood and general feeling is nice. justine"

33lcr187ip,8301,a very beautiful green blue . with a wonderful result.
i79h3edrvg,8302,nice contrast of red versus blue.
i79h3edrvg,8303,a good idea. i think this would have worked better if the numbers had been sharper and the colour more punch.
sixc0mmlzf,8304,nice shot.hope this does well for you.perhaps just a little grainy and could have benefited from neat image noise reduction
6tgorygp09,8305,not enough blue in the image for my taste.
5gdgyniu3u,8306,i dodnt know what it is but its a crazy looking image. i like the white pieces of the object.
09cc208k2g,8307,gorgeous detail. warmth of the red nicely offsets the blue.
vx96kweoyu,8308,"nice pic, good comp, but a bit overexposed."

rj4mo0rryp,8572,"this is really cool and well done! got the blur, feels chaotic, and its interesting!"
qejp07edrw,8573,the red lights detract a bit but love the galloping white horses and trainer.
mqvgomvhaj,8574,guess you will be marked down for too much sharpness but it is a nice image
mqvgomvhaj,8575,"nice image,really captures motion.too pretty to be a blurry mess tho"

bkrzxjiysg,8578,"not a lot to sustain interest here. the flowers are blurry, but no great effect is achieved. nice try."
kys4icen9u,8579,"it is a little blurry and a little disorganized and a little engaging and interesting but doesnt, imho, excel in any of them, sorry"
ftgzy86jrk,8580,"interesting and simple,im not sure it screams blurry mess tho."
ogsluk4z8t,8581,blurry and dizzying. i like the green light.
ogsluk4z8t,8582,"great motion capture of hands on git,"
tc64vutghq,8583,"good blur and chaos but imho not captivating though, sorry."
snbg3papym,8584,"the shapes arent helping make this interesting enuff on thier own,neither do the colors sorry,it is blurry tho."
rpal7qla08,8585,very beautiful colours. blurry. not awfully messy. i like it though.
rpal7qla08,8586,quite beautiful and serene. the blues and soft movement of something so powerful strangely provides a feeling of comfort. very nicely done.
rpal7qla08,8587,wonderful capture! i like everything about this.focused chaotic blur is what id call it.
153yni8vuh,8588,"a longer exposure time would have not only given you more light, but would also have given you more blur. nice try."
153yni8vuh,8589,dull color not a lot of blurr too
153yni8vuh,8590,really does have a period feel to it. bw works well.
q6czprtexi,8591,"focus,not really a blurry mess."

4oxmsxs9qr,8594,"looks a bit creepy. blurry, though not chaotic at all. i like it, however."
yc3xq4wufm,8595,"messy, not real blurry, but moderately intriguing all the same."
yc3xq4wufm,8596,slightly better than a as this is one of the only blurry photos that has held my interest for more than seconds so far!
3oi2rqfpw4,8597,"decent motion captured, but not really what i call a blurry mess"
zqyoazu7dt,8598,"dnmc, i think. chaos, yes, blurry or oof.no."
tmeo1f5wpo,8599,very cool and unique deb! congrats on th place!
tmeo1f5wpo,8600,nice colors and zoomy effect
5i2vddq8j5,8601,"definitely a mess, im dizzy."
tx3co0315t,8602,"blurry, not real messy, and a little too dark."
tx3co0315t,8603,i think you made a good choice in staying with the dull tones here sets a great mood.
tx3co0315t,8604,"nice. personally wish the colors were more vibrant, but i also think the murky mood of the darker colors in cool."
jf01yp3oma,8605,"im not exactly sure of what it is i am looking at, however i do know that its not a blurry mess!"
3m4ykuh7zj,8606,a excellent photo well exposed a framed the added blur gives an idea that this is by no means a static performance.
3m4ykuh7zj,8607,"a modest amount of blur, but no mess here."
0gskr0h6gk,8608,"very nice photo, but i just dont see it as a blurry mess. sorry."
0gskr0h6gk,8609,"not much of a blur, a nice picture, but not blurry enough."
0gskr0h6gk,8610,"a nice photo, however i dont think this really captures the essence of the blurry mess."
6b6by5c6mh,8611,not much blur except in the tips of those grasses
0ikg83x26a,8612,nice capture of motion. not very messy though.
0ikg83x26a,8613,"good movement blur on the birds . the image seems a little flat to me though, maybe some hue sat adjustments would help . not too chaotic or disorganised but a nice image none the less"
q60878gej0,8614,"i see the effect you were going for, but it doesnt quite work. too much light, i think."
q60878gej0,8615,"bizarre picture but oddly compelling. and a little blurry,"
npuomlfpla,8616,"id like more contrast to bring out the eyestill blurry, but more of a presence. thats just me tho."
20ixhlqbeg,8617,too sharp no blurr no mess ?
20ixhlqbeg,8618,"the photo is very over exposed, and not much of a blurry mess."

vy8q0rxjlr,8621,very nice photo. im not sure id consider it a blurry mess.
fzpoojw2eb,8622,great colors and blurry effect. not a lot to hold interest though.
3vgoz86dcs,8623,excellent capture with the movement of the snowflakes. nicely done.
3vgoz86dcs,8624,brr! i think the blur helps the feeling of frigidness!
5djxdnw9k7,8625,"nice capture of motion, but not very messy."
5djxdnw9k7,8626,"a bit more of a typical motion blur here,nice photo regardless."
o4m2n5um8t,8627,beautiful contrast. nice play of exposure.
rjagrk4cmd,8628,"i think this was really the best out there, at least second place. it looks so beautifully textures like a nice pecil or pastel drawing. teh green is killer just enough and balnced nicely by the blue. excellent."
8zmuambb8t,8629,id like to see the saturation boosted here and the contrast adjusted somewhat. the colors are kinda muted and the picture has a bit of a muddy look to it. the idea however is great though
8zmuambb8t,8630,"i like the watercolour feel to this image, the soft pastel tones really help."
zjp5qjsdo2,8631,nicely blurred well done lacks in the mess i guess
ff09ducycw,8632,excellent glowing colors here.
ff09ducycw,8633,seems like a chrysanthemum. . . on acid. fantastic color!
jygayf11rz,8634,the little gal with the oars looks like shes having a good time. nice bw.
2fqnyviv1d,8635,"nice idea, nice colors. but the big dark shadow on lelft is too dark, imo"
lviwoo4h1w,8636,beautiful weekend? it seems rather dark and cold to me.
ec2tb4o9ga,8637,"nice pov, clarity and color"
qgig5xh1l0,8638,lots of yellow. all in one place. maybe a little too much.
hlsclu20qn,8639,i like the soft colors. almost a pastel look.
68lt7q99al,8640,interesting play of lightand shadow
jly5w7nu7g,8641,"generally, i dont like these processing effects, but you have found the perfect balance between interest and craziness. nice job."
jly5w7nu7g,8642,this looks so cartoonish.a bit too much tonemapping for my taste
eg5wh7vivt,8643,i really love this one. the soft blur is a perfect choice.
eg5wh7vivt,8644,"painterly, lovely light. tutorial please!"
eg5wh7vivt,8645,lovely tones and processing. the softness works really well.
inkg5002oa,8646,"excellent, and a great black and white image here."
inkg5002oa,8647,interesting choice going with bw. you could have just as much impact showing in color and just calling it beached.
yb3x9eczvv,8648,i like this but there is a bit of a shadow or secondary image showing.
yb3x9eczvv,8649,not unpleasant with nice vivid blue and attractive mood.
16njeipqyi,8650,"good idea but i think looks too harsh, too flat with this amount of pp."
ywpvsilhvy,8651,love the bold colors. good pov. nice image.
lnsy5dg5ar,8652,a very nice straight forward photo. it seems the blues could be bluer and the greens are too green. ill give your photo a and did you know those cloud formations are called mares tails.
kg1l7khg7t,8653,shadows too dark imo. need a little more detail in them.
0bcwq4vbl5,8654,the pp on this is very nice. beautiful image. the softness gives it the feel of a misty evening.
qtpyfs8yt4,8655,a little fuzzy but nice effect nonetheless.
0ateutcphx,8656,"the whites seem blown out to me. if you attempting a ghostlike image, i think a gussian blur or some backlighting would have been better."
lca7nb7w19,8657,nice contrast and colour.good detail throughout.
z4ae0tb26f,8658,hi ernie. i used a hoya r ir filter. no other mods.
z4ae0tb26f,8659,"i really love this, irene. the silvery tones and smoothness is very appealing."
mvilml1bfa,8660,very nice. like the transition from grey to white
mvilml1bfa,8661,"silky smooth, soft as a babys bottom."
omxhyiykt1,8662,"okay, this i like. sharp, clear and, most of all, realistic. i really get the feeling that im there with them. perfect choice of processing or not processing, maybe for this photo."
g73dpsj8te,8663,love the reflections and the varied primary colors of the boats!
27z19i6p4l,8664,"needs indeed a sad mood, but the light is here more flat than sad."
j69btuz4g2,8665,it seems a bit blurry to me or maybe could be sharper or.it could be my monitor i guess. the colors are awesome.
j69btuz4g2,8666,"colors are nice but not as sharp, is this an hdr?"
x0ki3qq3oa,8667,looks rather idyllic and i like the light on the sails.
x0ki3qq3oa,8668,nice image.a little oversaturated for my tastes.
x0ki3qq3oa,8669,"a bit overprocessed, imo. looks a little surreal."
q52yewiktr,8670,looks a little blue on my monitor white balance issues?
q52yewiktr,8671,"wow, lotsa blue."
lpof2y4b0n,8672,colors are nice. setup seems a bit dull though
upx30tonmz,8673,life is better something together nice sentiment.
zr9qtnkitr,8674,this has just enough mystery and just enough definition to make me see so many possibilities. a very lovely .
behms6iorx,8675,good effort too much noise
g36cf9ta24,8676,certainly colorful and a good use of diagonals in an image.
nqv3xoun5v,8677,nice tone to this gives a timeless feel
n1z1wqxofc,8678,very colorful presentation of peddle boats.
n1z1wqxofc,8679,color contrast with the red and yellow is nice good job and fun idea.
y9eocbd32g,8680,"awesome! love the dark, rich tones and reflections."
y9eocbd32g,8681,this picture looks like a christmas card.but it is a little too dark for me
0fedj8nrgf,8682,"this has a wonderful feel to it. the colortone selected, the gulls following the boat.nicely done!"
0fedj8nrgf,8683,"lovely use of sepia dont think the vignette is necessary or adds to the photo but nonetheless, a great capture makes me think of jaws for some reason"
mwx54z2bfw,8684,love the misty feel to this. great work.
p1qgmml3jr,8685,very nice. i like the softness of this photo. the colors are nice. good job.
p1qgmml3jr,8686,your blue tones work very well with this nice image! makes it appear magical.
dp3xd6x9sm,8687,"striking image, love the color and the implied conflict."
dp3xd6x9sm,8688,interesting contrast two types of hightech.
umaayuu7y2,8689,i mean it in a good way though its dark in that intriguing way where you cant help but look at it.
umaayuu7y2,8690,"wonderful, dramatic, and luminous and not too dark at all!"
iwy5qfd5vm,8691,i dragging the line a boating term? i dont know what it means and the image doesnt really show me. you did pretty well for what looks to be some harsh challenging light.
6ev522uvbm,8692,"im kind of antiselective desat these days, but this is well done."
6ev522uvbm,8693,"i like the pp it just seems a little to dark, maybe a little more detail. still a very good image."
6ev522uvbm,8694,"great historic, regional appeal! would have liked to seen a more brilliantcolored use of selective desat to make it pop"
do5sz754pe,8695,"nice hdr processing, great colors. makes this image interesting. well done."
do5sz754pe,8696,nice colors but the dirty concrete doesnt help
k49ft2vrnw,8697,that all said i really like the variety of lights and colors you have here. the nn did pretty good taking care of most of your noise issues.
dzl6lgxtky,8698,wonderful coloring and i really enjoy the double splash from the paddles.
g5a8wozkwg,8699,beautiful light and excellent comp.
v5i0tfx2gg,8700,not a sign of the common yellow cast from the lights on the white hulls. good job on this.
2ra4hpbju5,8701,"this seems to have an hdr glow about it the colors arent just popping, theyre attacking! very interesting other than that."
gw919anuqi,8702,the clouds look a bit over processed i like the bw
auj6yoyqoc,8703,nice image and great job with the duotone.
fs6i3g2wfn,8704,"such an unusual, unique perspective.just have to love it! glad you selected to process in b w so dramatic!"
qndb7mvfls,8705,nt sure i like the desat on this one
zq2snzp0k0,8706,the stark contrast is great. nice mountains.
wp9lz53n24,8707,nice clear work here. like to see thisin color
bb3pctgwsl,8708,lovely handling of the light and pp.
txk1p5ckq0,8709,stunning. peaceful and yet moody. terrific bw.
8qrqr1nuip,8710,good balance bluey im usually acurate at picking the winner
8qrqr1nuip,8711,"very nicely done, especially the outstretched finders. black and white was a perfect choice for this photo."
y9467okol9,8712,"there is a bit of motion blur on the handsarms though, and now that ive seen it i keep looking at it ."
y9467okol9,8713,"it was on account of the blurred appendages. penny didnt like em either. still, a cool pic."
319q0v7dvq,8714,excellent image. the black and white works extremely well here. good work setzler
lz3q4oquvs,8715,far to much red in this pic
dmqt3yrpg3,8716,this is great! the colors and clarity are wonderful and i love the content. great work!
nxnipbyzp3,8717,the softness of this image is wonderful. good job.
exrc0c3jtv,8718,i think it needs to be sharper. great idea and good contrast.
hroer08xw0,8719,"very cool effect. i love the way light can shine through fingers. great idea, carried off well."
r20039g6yf,8720,"nice dark tones, but a bit blunt as an image."
p9go1s9tyw,8721,i would like to see this duotoned or in bw im sure it would be fantastic!
418qk4oytm,8722,"cameradigital processing techwise a good image. nice balance of colors, exposure is ok and good whitebalance."
418qk4oytm,8723,"nice ccomposition and warm tones, this is quite a teaser, hope we will see the front one day."

05td7zakq6,8725,good work. love the brownish color tone.
3e7ax66oz7,8726,nice image maybe bw could have added some more impact as it looks a little orange.
4ek6b2c0hx,8727,there is a great tutorial on black and white conversions on the site which might me useful
4ek6b2c0hx,8728,firstly there is a great free download filter for black and white conversions called optik verve
0jobh7fxpb,8729,heh yay for texas blue bonnets!
0jobh7fxpb,8730,fantastic photo. beautiful bluebonnets and great colors and contrast.

2qpzs091t6,8732,nice grip i just wish the wb were set a bit better the hands seem too orange
jqb979tvc4,8733,"oh so true. good idea , lacks contrast and saturation"
73utsweacb,8734,needs to be brighter and more hue saturation
73utsweacb,8735,nice image cant help but think this could be so much stronger as bw image
j82nj2aejy,8736,nice image nice sharpness where it matters
e81oqy1jis,8737,"kinda neat, but to me its still just a blurry image."
n7zk9x7eno,8738,nice image like the softness cant help think it might have been better as bw?
krhuko2rw0,8739,beautiful capture with exceptional detail. its shots like this that help me learn.
9v23mc6rmt,8740,wonderful subtlety. love the pale hues as well as the idea.
9v23mc6rmt,8741,beautiful capture. just enough color to make it interesting and of course you have to wonder what shes thinking.
ytf5r898rl,8742,the light is just a little overexposed for my taste. it has a little bit of harshness to it that makes the hands look unnatural.
xieh4dpkry,8743,"not sure i care for the treatment of this, but nice detail."
0ad1wf060x,8744,"wow, that is a good photo, and the bw is perfect. not much more you can say about this except, excellent."

9qxkq3xyi5,8746,great macro and gratz on the yellow.
k714br2ntx,8747,parts is parts. great capture and i particularily like the color tone
k714br2ntx,8748,"sepia works well. great action, looks pretty intense."
irybnjw91b,8749,"great photo, the idea is great and colors are rich and vivid. however it seems you went a little overboard with the burning on the hands"
es7wsjs1b3,8750,"great details and textures, good bw conversion"
nwajushfd8,8751,could be a good add for a nursery. a little too much light on the fingers.
nwajushfd8,8752,nice image maybe it would be stronger in bw find the pp a little too much.
s17ag1n8lp,8753,classic shot.and i like the detail of the heart.
le3ukobsan,8754,nice and sharp but a tad boring and flat looking.
kj8ns3a525,8755,nice image nice and soft feel to this.
z86he7e0ia,8756,this has sort of an odd orange cast to it perhaps white balance correction?
uwlca5o2vo,8757,"deft use of light, great pose."
1ttzdsyeki,8758,nice image find the bright orange feel to this just a tad overpowering though
1ttzdsyeki,8759,blurry feet. looks like the reds are oversaturated?
1bf762drb9,8760,oh my this is so soft im afraid to breathe in fear it will change.
ccmworu6tz,8761,nice image nice tones maybe just a tad too grey.
akbqxm2g0e,8762,i like this idea and execution. my only criticism would be that the light is just a bit harsh. it would be great if it had a softer feel to it.
57zg8qvw8t,8763,"typically you think of his as cracked, dry and unappealing whereas hers would be soft and kissable, but the way you display it here there is no contrast between the two. im not sure what to think of this."
z1ijrdo871,8764,lovely detail and black and white conversion
kz8oa7rwkm,8765,interesting image. i almost feel as if it is a weensy bit too dark. there is quite a lot of intricate imagery that is getting lost.
kz8oa7rwkm,8766,great effect caught here. bw works great with this artistic movement.
ers04d9xbm,8767,too soft for my taste. but the idea is nice.
llgxn00pyx,8768,the color of your models eyelashes is what makes this stand out. not the most original of ideas but executed perfectly.
i8zck4ytb1,8769,nice image maybe bw could have made this a little more of a stronger image?
mzxm2mp95x,8770,nice idea let down a little with technical skills sharpness is lacking.
f3tdcglv4w,8771,i like the idea of the pic and coloring that you used.
zihnyjh144,8772,i think that a more diffused light might have made the highlights a little bit less harsh. but that is my only critisim and i am not sure if it would even work.
u4qev6mzye,8773,beautifull. you could make it better with a little more light in front.
oyfvyu9yya,8774,cool motion blur in the wings. very nice.
9zssi5lgo5,8775,nice colors and light. cheerful and bright!
9zssi5lgo5,8776,". bright colors. wow, those mugs are not what you want to see the morning after a lot of heavy drinking."
elmg3bn9ge,8777,she looks very noble and wise. love the brown tones throughout.
v0gihoml17,8778,"i dont like the red tho, maybe a white would look better with more light on the bible?"
tz2knf2jb7,8779,cool! the textures in this photos fits really well and so does the colour.
iw7m9axr2c,8780,not as sharp as i would like you really have to do something special with flowers so commonly chosen.
4gg7c5utbh,8781,lovely romantic feel soft and feminine
rtk66er58f,8782,"the tones work great, the red a nice touch. well done !"
imo12qbyz7,8783,"very nice pic, great color and detail."
2842j0thdq,8784,bravo bokeh.well balanced color and texture.
2b8luyjtt0,8785,initial impact ouch grainy.
0ak39q4gn0,8786,quite fabulous. i dont think it could be improved in any way. my choice for blue. and added to favs
y4hvq7duup,8787,"i love it! love the colors and movement.a bit dark on my monitor, but wonderful"
txsvsnweka,8788,love it! theres something about the look of this one. the colors and contrast really pop on it. it makes something otherwise boring seem way more interesting. great job!
f4v0ddrpje,8789,"beautiful picture, the only but about the picture is the distraction of the cars"
a0zjc73fx3,8790,"vey nice, appears slightly noisy."
jfh6ke9a7t,8791,great use of colors and contrast.its really noisy on my monitor? great photo though
3jdlxg06nk,8792,"great pic, maybe just a tad dark?"
vwswftoz8s,8793,"very cute, maybe a curves adjustment or more contrast whould make it more striking."
zckeg1lsll,8794,what? a ripoff of my new years resolution ii ? funny.
f3v4zsps9u,8795,"green looks a bit artificial, and consequently the red appears to be a bit overdone as well. nice idea and attempt, though."
wcclu4sihh,8796,"excellent work, nice comp and colors"
zwj5d376xh,8797,nice work. the mushrrooms look like they have a bit of noise but i feel it adds to the image.
oj2y8rigi4,8798,good try but the noise is a little unsettling.
4nxxv3564d,8799,i think i would have liked this even more if the saturation was a little less. the color is a bit overpowering.
1fr3l1uiuh,8800,"niice . like the edge of the leaves, the multiple layered leaves shadow ."
xfxy02pomr,8801,terrific capture with sharp details.
gaxq4vty7b,8802,beautiful! great colors nice work!
664rjardru,8803,pity your model is blurry otherwise this would have been great
hypcogh3tb,8804,the selective desaturation is just not doing it for me here. im guessing that the full color version would be quite a bit beter.
hypcogh3tb,8805,"did you do this with canons mycolors settings, a filter, or what?"
hypcogh3tb,8806,i dont think the desat works here. good on ya for doing it within the basic rules though.
hypcogh3tb,8807,nice job with the selective coloring
fg4b8qfbja,8808,"wow, great capture and great tones on the white feathers. the bright yellow is what makes this photo!"
kxr81bg1vf,8809,"ooh! so much green, such a little bug.i like it."
pk93n4m93m,8810,"nice, although a bit too much contrast for my liking."
pk93n4m93m,8811,another standout that popped at me when i was scanning the thumbnails. i like the light effect and would really like to know how it was done. nice saturation of the colors. i like it.
23n3gu40rd,8812,nice capture. sharpness is good.
6e5060d3h3,8813,a very nice soft image. real fragile.
09fsxtr24o,8814,"light is a little harsh, other than that good"
p2odolubjm,8815,"i usually cant stand these waterglass shots, but this one it different. great feel to the photo it really does capture the essence of tipsy! and the color is great."
6i06tpgrj8,8816,very beautiful arrangement and contrast of colours.
bw91t5tz0b,8817,very good capture. motion blur
mlpwmtyxex,8818,gorgeous color! this makes quite a marvelous abstract.very nicely done.
cnfeh67qjq,8819,highlights just a little blown out as you can see lose of texture in the highlights.
j3vp0928of,8820,very nice. i was admiring the motion blur and then the wheelie kind of surprised me pleasantly!
5zxnx6tvuo,8821,"like the idea but i personally hate pictuers of idols, icons, statues, etc.unless extemely unique"
zm8a3qtaxg,8822,"a different kind of photo, i like it, has a very soft feeling to it."
22c3graius,8823,really lovely. maybe the best ive sen so far. love the color variations.
16cpfu3cz3,8824,"very nice, , and i hope you arent getting dinged for no light circles, lol"
3cewclr703,8825,nice sharpness . and a great pose !
t0owzqz0b8,8826,wonderful colours and detail. fantastic.

ezzn41ottb,9094,love the blue and the sheen to the pieces and the other frosty ones.
wo2eshr9pm,9095,"beautiful details, sharpness and warm colors."
thlch6cobh,9096,timing here is perfect and the brown tones work very well. nice work.
r2ozcwha1d,9097,well done gary . another blue . great photo and a great mind to think of it .
r2ozcwha1d,9098,splash! great lighing here! this has unique creativity all over it! danny
8s69kgpyxe,9099,"good bw i like the tool, good detail."
da0ibryat5,9100,great shot.love the black and white with the red and green accents.well done!
ep6iaimya3,9101,"great idea and compsotion, amazing swirls. i am very interested in how you did this. like the colors."
ep6iaimya3,9102,good job. my dad used to do that. only nit is the black at the bottom.
ep6iaimya3,9103,would have been way cool against pure black. very neet though.
6xomuz7swb,9104,nice color! i like that courve of color!
84pflhlx01,9105,"thats is a crazy picture, nice choice for black and white, if you did it on your computer or whatever.just a good choice of black and white."
c19mp2iex0,9106,"very dark, hard to see what is going on here. may have benefited from a different light source."
n7y6p27aok,9107,i love dark pictures this has great subtle detail.
nhiqf44k27,9108,this is gorgeous and mysterious. the light is perfect.
gi84gjal1o,9109,very elegant. nice sepia tones.
gi84gjal1o,9110,i like the sepia tone. good compositio.
bnskegbarx,9111,this allout explosive amount of grain isnt working for me.
kn2rnvi8fg,9112,too bad the colors of the rocks didnt come out as good as they can. good caputure.
qenz6ngeuu,9113,nice play of lights! very clean and balanced.
qenz6ngeuu,9114,"good effort, and exposure nightmare i guess?"
82xnxbynne,9115,"this is rather blurry. could benefit from some sharpness, and the light is a bit harsh as well."
82xnxbynne,9116,"nice idea, unfortunately a bit blurry"
5p2b3pjohp,9117,"nice black and white picture. however, i think itd be better if you capture the whole arms."
fyq97icacz,9118,"really beautiful. i love the way the light has caught the, the, the whatsits."
jq6k37x721,9119,im not sure the colors lend anything to the picture.
jq6k37x721,9120,beautiful. love the blurred movement capture and the extensive darkness. a little too orange is my only negative.
jq6k37x721,9121,wow beautiful! lovely lightning. the best picture ive seen so far
cpsrpxvkg6,9122,if i was reshooting i think i whould replace one or two of the layered shooters with classic drinks to provide some balance.
cpsrpxvkg6,9123,"i like the drinks and use of color, but they dont seem hot to me. the coloring makes them feel very cool. good idea though."
cpsrpxvkg6,9124,great use of colour. and illusion.
cpsrpxvkg6,9125,"i hope, u did not taste them before, it seems like a monday morning all blue"
twd6mjeuo0,9126,nice a little overexposed at least on my monitor but nice capture.
vajvepv9yz,9127,"nice. the colors are perfect as is the idea and execution. if there was just a little more detail of the little one, it would be awesome. still a very inspired photo!"
5hfeyirhii,9128,"this is unque, the colors are great ,i like it, the light is very good, great clarity"
wgixzox7d4,9129,"the mood here is very enticing, with the contrasted colors at night."
wkjcekfl1x,9130,"nice picture, to bad those reflections of light are in there, it would habe been alot better if they wernt."
wkjcekfl1x,9131,"that looks wierd, good color, nice detail."
cwutg26n3j,9132,interestingly great. i like the abstractness and colors.
q0y9hqlvgm,9133,i like it quite a bit. id probably like it even more if there were a bit more dark areas in the photo.
deyn06h0aa,9134,those reflections. you need some kind of defuser for that light.
fz47elq5h3,9135,it would have been better if more bleachers had been shown and the photographers shadow wasnt visible.
2a7smftlw4,9136,its seems more like evening creeping in then morning to me. theres also some grainyness there in the picture.
lm4shd0mtz,9137,i really enjoy this photo. this is one of the relatively few instances of desaturating all but one color that seems to work very nicely. i see this technique used here frequently but can rarely determine the reason for it. red is a color of strength and power and you have used that to your advantage in this photograph.
we8knbxrfg,9138,"good color, good use of light, i like the detail."
119sxhjv39,9139,"i love the vibrant red, orange, yellow shades. well done."
119sxhjv39,9140,image quality seems rather . textured im trying to think of a better word for it but. hopefully youll understand what i mean?
pinrropeez,9141,"i definitely do not want to discourage you, i think you took a solid photo in general, it just needs a little more atmosphere and a dash more creativity to give it a standout look."
80hhuragqn,9142,wonderful photo.terrific color and clarity.this looks as if it could be a wonderful painting.great job!
80hhuragqn,9143,"nice sharp image, color and contrast are nice too. well done"
s22jjg18tz,9144,there is a sharpness and clarity to this image that is very good. the light and shadow on the walk way create interesting visual interest.
n48jh8aqhd,9145,beautiful reflections and the light is gorgeous
18vb5ghajt,9146,very nice idea. i think more contrast or slight adjustment of levels would have made the image punch a little more.
rgijs86lpd,9147,"nice interpritation, good picture, nice use of light."
sm7vkyfc12,9148,"finally, the image has a bit of noise. noise reduction, e.g. via neatimage, would have addressed that easily."
sm7vkyfc12,9149,this look so. surreal. did you adjust the hue in photoshop? because so much beauty cannot just walk around free on the hills. i just love it.
shtircuptz,9150,"moons a little hot, but probably a trade off. very interesting."
shtircuptz,9151,i love the light and the shadows and the colors. great capture
syy55kq5eq,9152,"daniel day lewis would be proud! i dont like the yellow or red in the pillows, i would really like to see this in sepia tone or black and white."
5n14sblhby,9153,ooh too good. very neat ideai hope others will get it. good job!
vdzwdjbth2,9154,looks pretty noisy. yikes find a quieter looking place to find silence.
9a6evisqhd,9155,"nice colors, perhaps a bit too saturated, maybe a bit too sharp"
26toqtw0cf,9156,fun shottitle. i do think the colors look a little muted. maybe a wee bit of saturation would of helped bring this to life.
vr2kymf8pk,9157,"personal taste i love the bw, the grain, the mystery"
vr2kymf8pk,9158,fantastic use of light and shadow. great
vr2kymf8pk,9159,"dark, muted and old feel to this. however seems to be too much noise going on and not enough clarity to truly appreciate the effort."
txbsgom0fn,9160,it took a while to realise this was a triple exposure. maybe less time omn each exposure would have added to the ghostly feeling? nice idea.
m4iseawrb8,9161,join the red and black club good pic. i love it.
jhlr4m80y7,9162,wonderful building.looks just like i would have imagined. good find. the light is a little bright but i did enjoy seeing this.
2s8hkagg6d,9163,"really nice capture, lonely feel, dark and spooky."
aadgfhyl08,9164,"the first thing that strikes me is the color. it seems like a sepia tone, but perhaps exaggerated? the richness of the color is just amazing which is why i wonder about that. i think it really works well for this photo, it doesnt give it an antiquing look like most sepias do, but instead it gives both a unique feel and also highlights my next observation"
aadgfhyl08,9165,"nice picture, ad nice choice with the sepia that you used, i think thats what it is!"
9kckgr1mwx,9166,a cute photo but way too much neat image.
dtdjrre1c1,9167,nice capture of color. sharpness is off.
9vxyl0r1l2,9168,very nice. light is a bit harsh. it creates bright spots.
jr9bwikoai,9169,"very nice, love the lighing, shades and sharpness, well done"
lol6fr7wmh,9170,different. colors are nice the way the blend.
lol6fr7wmh,9171,great color and detail. amazon.com sales rank
fo0ii0lyrz,9172,this reminds me of those hide and seek games. very busy but not very sharp.
txt5n4ib0v,9173,nice pic. wish is was in color.
9hr69v41am,9174,nice capture of nature. colors are very defined.
zxangmpnzc,9175,nice blue colors against that black. pretty sharp too.
5god3kdqui,9176,"about the picture the light is very good, the rocks in front"
7l0k6goumi,9177,"god, this is so funny! i love the funky color tones and the setup is perfect. bumping you from a to a !"
7l0k6goumi,9178,pretty good staging on this one. colors are nice but not too sharp.
6tyohs6nn1,9179,i think reflections can be difficult to portray well and this looks a little flat so maybe a boost in contrast would have helped convery the mood you were after?
8qtz1vixwn,9180,the blur is rather overdone for my taste. i like my mystery to be a little more subtle. a personal taste i know.
z6su1darsv,9181,nice photo. some natural light would have enhanced it a bit.
y14nrfbhz8,9182,what a beautiful picture you have taken. well deserve the blue. congrates
y14nrfbhz8,9183,dreamy. lovely colors. one of my faves
dzitc3evgz,9184,p.s. not to mention that the technicals on this image are sharp and beautiful.
dzitc3evgz,9185,"a little contrasty, the exposure looks ok."
z8fernkd6p,9186,photo has way too much noise for me.
6z8qznl2xy,9187,"some times bw conversion just doesnt work for me, than i wonder on a technicall sound image if it would look better in color.hmm."
7hdvqizu5o,9188,aww this is very cute! the girls are soo sweet but they do look vrey bored and it is very realistic. i like the bnlack and white also.
ae05gutrld,9189,"great exposure, colors good,nice."
z0yrkik2k5,9190,"nice set, not sure she looks bored though, more shes thinking of answer. like bw."
dyc8mtccko,9191,"lots going on in this image, along with motion. technically good, white balance, colors sharpness.just ok for me."
r5mhtmgz7l,9192,"i like this. the selective desat works for me, and thats saying something. i dont see that many where it really works well."
r5mhtmgz7l,9193,"i like the photo, but it doesnt say bored to me. it might say tired or weary or need help but i dont see bored. im giving you on the photo quality."
15lyc4o6ly,9194,"very nice exposure, great composition.this image works well for me."
0o0gil4laj,9195,great job! good texture and shadows.
wx13j8lfts,9196,i was quite simply bored with the familiarity of my daily surroundings so i have taken to photographing obscure things and from unusual angles.
150lz9l0zw,9197,this is a nice image for boredom. i know i get incredibly bored at night when i am trying to work on some kind of paperwork. i liek how this image was done in black and white and i also liek all the contrast seen in the image. nice work.
taut4ndrhx,9198,good exposure always makes a good bw image.nice work.
sv345zw8f7,9199,"heh, a stretch, but i like it. i think a beige color would have worked better for this photo."
fcz42335iu,9200,i like your use of light. the stark look adds to the atmospere
fcz42335iu,9201,i like this alot. nice choice in bw.
urzdkkhyjm,9202,for a picture taken at a photography convention i think thats what it is this ppicture has pour quality. might just be my screen though
6qlr1ozs19,9203,"cute shot.i personally dont care for the grain, not sure if it was intentional or not."
ry3y3w000z,9204,i like the color and the lights and the content.
4gl21s7taz,9205,"prolly win, best quality foto out of all the snap shots so far."
44hb8ncrjm,9206,"nice candid, the colors look a little flat, it could be my monitor."
s2bo82j0wj,9207,seems you may have a cast over your picture. like the white balance is off or something.
fymx0ygi3h,9208,this is a fantastic image. sharp and clear. good qualtiy.
1c1h0if48e,9209,"the mood in this is almost palpable. great cpature, well done!"
1c1h0if48e,9210,this is a nice image. i like how the image was taken in black and white. nice job.
inoy9ly2bz,9211,maybe some usm would help get the photo sharper?
k1au2z9gv1,9212,. noise way too much noise all over this show
rivfgqime8,9213,"nice setting, good composition,well done bw."
0kcnskp5hk,9214,great response to the directions to not make the picture boring. has a lot of movement for a picture of boredom.
cvz4mvtpes,9215,"not too much detail in this photo, try increasing contrast, or something, it would be good to have more detial, or a more appealing photo, so that the audience wants to look at it for a longer period of time in other words, a good photo attracts the audience."
h5c8097swh,9216,"nice bw, like the shadows, would had been nice to show some action in the thumbs only."
h5c8097swh,9217,"a motion blur in the thumbs would have sold me on this photo, at least i think without really seeing the results. still the best thumb twirling photo ive seen."
3qy22t1idt,9218,"interesting, glad to see it validated, does look like selected saturation. nice job."
3qy22t1idt,9219,a mouthful of mysterious markups
3qy22t1idt,9220,i dont feel that the desat adds anything of value to this pic. sorry
oxg6aet10i,9221,very nice use of light to bring out the texture. i dont know if it suggests boredom to me though
ys31kf3npn,9222,"nice but not boring,also for me. it would be more interesting with a bit more light on the bottom ."
ys31kf3npn,9223,"interesting, appears a litte soft."
o1ap9ceo29,9224,"well done, bw sets the mood on this one, well composed, exposure and shadows are great."
3e9mcy9rfk,9225,"looks a little hot in some ares, name tag, little on the chicks fingers, could be my monitor.good compositioncrop.just doesnt do it for me."
a0n0aby5ff,9226,great work! bw suits this perfectly.
vmqi860ozs,9227,im there twice a day.lol.looks a little contrasty to me.
9afe5szvby,9228,"yes this is a pure way to solve bordem expessically when your sad! this is a very nice image, the colors look great!"
9afe5szvby,9229,"chocolet is never boring, i like the colors, but not a bored"
9afe5szvby,9230,"i like it. exposure just a little soft? could be my monitor. good pop in the colors, sharp."
3ro3rtrvbn,9231,artful! i like the limited dofbackground colors complement nicely. i just dont see bored here.
konsx7zc45,9232,"the skiin is a little overexposed, other than that i like it."
aaxblrys42,9233,"bored? maybe tired, or overwhelmed, or pissed off. dunno. yellow tint from the lights throw the white balance off a little too much."
a06bx1742d,9234,"odd sensation, i feel like im actually moving! slick photo."
nxkimwr5xv,9235,"great shot.technically perfect, sharp, good contrast, very nicely composed, i hate white skies, but this works."
nywl6653dw,9236,"from ny.lol.i like the noise, helps set the mood."
w8kdp0z7e3,9237,a lot of digital artifacts and blurring.
w8kdp0z7e3,9238,your photo is aughly blurry
opsihr0b96,9239,i like this a lot. of course the quality is a bit crap. but i think its a brilliant capture.
op503stwvq,9240,ohh. the texture is beautiful! i love it.
x2fuzj7o80,9241,excelent use of bw. it trully makes the picture.
ufipzclyn1,9242,nice portrait work and a nice rich conversion and tone.
wwhe1fxqao,9243,"wendy, what an amazing capture of pure boredom! well done!"
5lnaxn9sij,9244,"why does this image remind me of something out of clockwork orange? there is an inherent feel of great menace here rather than boredom. still, its a great capture well done."
xowr9v6yeh,9245,good idea to get close in. labs seem to have that unique look when they are disinterested
o7hlnyrawo,9246,"a very interesting photo, but i wish something could be done about the noise"
2g5d1lfl07,9247,"a great idea, but it appears to be a little darker than necessary to be truly effective. a good solid effort though. i like the motion capture, although i might have preferred to see a little more of the hands. solid effort."
zdoy430bhg,9248,cars? nah. something that makes lots of noise and annoys mom is what i would give him.
fshqaqvwjd,9249,"nice picture, but im a bit bothered by the yellowish colour cast."
gmdmfo75qk,9250,"does not strike me as a bored, but thats my opinion. who cares! like the pose and mood."
s21mhrcae2,9251,"wow, this is a very nice picture but so oversharpened that it almost doesnt look like a photo. with less sharpening this would be wonderful."
q2aeqquvt8,9252,nice use of line and color!
t6365x91uq,9253,too much shadow patterning without obvious and visible reason
jo6r9mia98,9254,feels a bit washed out to me. i think a saturation boost would help the aesthetics somewhat.
hj7vij5ot5,9255,imo a bit more contrast would make this a lot stronger photo.
u66aeiu6g1,9256,i like this one.great old scifi movie quality
sj0jug4kw9,9257,"i love the colors, but the sharpness and detail are a bit of a let down."
f9mvbe1i4w,9258,"wow. lots of contrast here, and it works really well. the pic has a real gritty feel to it. great job"
bnoknqtryo,9259,i think the wow factor for me is mostly in the warm glow that reflects the feeling one gets when there is something alive and green around them.
bnoknqtryo,9260,"clever use of light, find the offset image mildly disturbing but interesting. maybe i just like being disturbed."
35kft32ozf,9261,very nice to use black white. good visualisation.
67xfbdo6ec,9262,did you add motion blur on photoshop ? its too blurry for me.
67xfbdo6ec,9263,the colors blending is nice
67xfbdo6ec,9264,"colour is awesome, captured motion wonderfully. nice to look at."
ksu6hr1prf,9265,i love this photograph. what clarity and color. a true professional presentation. amazing.
gfn8847cce,9266,"excellent vibrant photograph. i can feel the textures, smooth, prickly. nice!"
gfn8847cce,9267,"great detail, fine work"
jc8ylyl9qz,9268,"feels very grainy, and on my monitor is a bit dull"
ltt9ebedvf,9269,the reds in my opinion are a little too dark and saturated but that is down to personal taste.
2eu69zgcol,9270,did this look bad in color ? . bc i dont think the bw works too well here.
de22yr0cqx,9271,would lie to see a slightly more saturated green. never the less a nice study. bol
ahwz182smr,9272,love this! great colors and balance of foregroundbackground
768t64z2ig,9273,"the only other thing that i would do is play with some of individual color saturation levels to bring out a little more of the blues, yellows and perhaps the greens as well."
k8ts3v2kyo,9274,"a bit overexposed, loss of any texture."
l424fp5b47,9275,"beautiful colors, contrast, and clarity. nicely done."
rjkhwwhld9,9276,weird color reduction confuses but does not improve the photo
rdd96iqlcq,9277,nice colors! wish the bees were just a tad sharper.
uacq2amw6y,9278,yikes! how creepy. i never knew aphids came in christmas colors! good macro.
u1hojimmi6,9279,"great job, love the colors and thyme."
7os1rgezbq,9280,"nice image, slight blown out for my taste, i like the orange contrast"
m5o69qvwrk,9281,feels a touch overexposed or washed out. a bit of sharpness would help.
rulra2lj6p,9282,wow . neat . not sure how much i like the overexposing there but still very nice
qclrxjdyw4,9283,very nicely done. however too much green for my taste.
pg6umjqpmz,9284,fantastic use of light. great detail and texture!
bwp8qiw7kw,9285,this image is really flat. its not very colorful and vibrant. if you play with some of the color saturation it could be brought more to life.
9yj3he3ppt,9286,"not just a botanical picture, but a study of propogation. like the motion and colors"
wsc33mvyga,9287,amazing capture. i love the clarity and color of this photograph.
b3mvfmfa42,9288,a nice capture but not very nice colors. too artaficial.
qce5ksiv5m,9289,that is so cool. with the progression of colorage. really imaginative idea! love the contrast and the detail.
46g61mq1ff,9290,such vivid coloring and sharpness. like it and give it a .
jsn1404brt,9291,wonderfully structured image and the use of backlighting makes the picture that little bit different.bumping from to .
1onfv30y77,9292,"lovely image. simplistic, eyecatching, great contrast of color against black. very oriental. really like it."
9c3miqy5l9,9293,"theres just something about the patterns, colors and details that keeps drawing you in the more you study the image. wait! . how to escape?"
9c3miqy5l9,9294,"bold, brilliant colors. a beautiful photo indeed."
rpngqcixg4,9295,"beautiful, love the desaturation effect, very nice!"
rvjt4krbwt,9296,this is fantastic! funny and unique and my pick for
aa4wwlh56x,9297,"nice, judi! i like it. especially the dark intensity."
ndgurhzs6w,9298,the black and white with graininess gives this a real classic feel.
gswswo9lnp,9299,love this! the black and white conversion is perfect. moo!
mbf4js93wc,9300,good use of duotone to add extra interest to this photo it helps to bring out the grassy details
n1tymfaz94,9301,"love the saturated colours, not so fond of the halos around the cows."
rvgak7g2ff,9302,a bit too contrasty andor oversharpened but colours are good.
wrzh14y3ik,9303,"this looks like a dream. a big, hairy, orange dream."
mun6u8a9bj,9304,thats fun. the light n shadows. ghostly feel. i like it. gave me pause
eg4esbpb6u,9305,"you dont mention any postprocessing, but it looks to me like you upped the contrast a bit, and it may have affected the clouds a bit too much there are spots on them that are a bit overblown, it seems."
f3uxjx082s,9306,i dont really see how this pertains to branches. its a good photo though. cool colors.
u4ar7gml3q,9307,oh very neat with the light and the colors.
0fppgra18z,9308,i would have liked it better if the blue wasnt so pixelated.
oltjtd21t5,9309,you could have done so much more with this picture! mess with the colors and such.so much potential!
q2yrn9vkuv,9310,"very dark. perhaps it is my moniter, but i see little detail at all."
q2yrn9vkuv,9311,waay too dark. looks like it might be an interesting place in the day time.
q2yrn9vkuv,9312,this is too dark and underexposed on my system to see what you had in mind. sorry
q2yrn9vkuv,9313,this needs more light not alot. you wouldnt want to lose the feeling of thicknessjumbled branches.
q2yrn9vkuv,9314,too dark perhaps some tweaking on levels would help
b4ec3djc5r,9315,i really dont like the colors! it seems a little bit overcontrasted and there is way to much going on for my taste! but yet its a neat idea!
opy0vkjaw1,9316,"weird blue and magenta color cast, watch your white balance. still gets a from me though"
ogqxcb9djy,9317,wow. colors are cool and the idea is really cool
d5zuoe63cb,9318,"this is very intresting, first one like this so far. hehe. nice job and i like how you uused black and white! great job!"
pkr6ekkv8w,9319,"good capture, slightly more contrast would add to the detail of the image."
zd5yxfxah1,9320,"technically wise, the photo lacks crispness and is possibly overexposed."
ytwujp2lnv,9321,"what a great picture! i would have loved to have seen this a little larger, and with greater contrast."
4pi8jp139n,9322,oo very cool. i like all the detail. nice nice.
4pi8jp139n,9323,love the macro. interesting take on it and the color variations are lovely.
a341dcurdu,9324,good pic id like to see more contrast but my own opinion
txdlk9j6ou,9325,"neat! ive never seen a cactus like that in my life! then again, i live in nashville, tennessee! lol"
k8w72we8dg,9326,"this was intresting. i was going to take a picture of this at my school. nice, and i like how you chose to make it black and white."
q7fgse563z,9327,amazing. the dark trees really stand out with that cloud. nice picture!
q7fgse563z,9328,"this is a great picture and the use of bw is an excellent choice, hope this picture does well."
dczdhpkjvs,9329,excellent photo! gotta love those blue angels!
zeee4ztgcn,9330,the tint is a little grey

ylytz9dxrp,9388,wow this is realy great i think that the colors are awsome! the way u got it to fae. too cool!
ylytz9dxrp,9389,"bright, and nice contrast, but its just not doing it for me.it looks really staged and fake, and i think you could have done so much more with the topic."
ylytz9dxrp,9390,"like the gradient coloration, am not judge so have no idea if that is too much editing or not, lol, but i do like the photo"
ylytz9dxrp,9391,impressive colors and shilouette i like it
beeehsd9o8,9392,this has great potential. i think id work on curves and contrast so that it really pops out at you. i love the rays through the trees.
beeehsd9o8,9393,"more trunks than branches but i lovethe rays of light, interesting bw reduction, well framed"
vpreo1odll,9394,nice job with the coloring. very vivid.

svxae0mwyw,9414,i like the bright white.kinda shows the innocence of childhood.
bs4tlhwwf7,9415,interesting and unique! great job!
vcqr3m6epw,9416,"seems a little unsaturated? maybe you did it on purpose, pretty neat."
vcqr3m6epw,9417,it would have been really neat if your model could have been robed or wearing something you would see in lord of the rings as this setting has a mystical feel to it.
tfad6aywu3,9418,"selective desaturation green yellow saturated, others desaturated."
tfad6aywu3,9419,well done illusion of selective desat. very effective in its expressiveness.
z09ajtcjas,9420,well composed and captured. your exposure is excellent. great blackness contrasted with vivid light. nicely done.
ziit7qhlt1,9421,"i wish the image was a bit sharper. also, i wish we could see the path a bit better."
ziit7qhlt1,9422,i would have liked more contrast. the picture could be bigger to let us see more details. its a little blurry.
7xvoi42bki,9423,love this image. the yellow green from the trees behind is a little overpowering though. maybe you could do a little selective desaturation. nice job.
annv2q8mw1,9424,i like the picture and the setting but it seems a little blurry.
urv2xv6703,9425,"interesting branches, nice colour."
urv2xv6703,9426,"nice job, but it would have had a lot more impact in bw."
olu9vx4aex,9427,"a very nice image, dark, broody, mournful.yet at the same time beautiful."
f80jysq5o2,9428,green color is a natural symbol of joy
f80jysq5o2,9429,the green on green totaly works for this picture.its super good!
17ss0l2wy8,9430,maybe it would be improved by increasing contrast and a little bit of levels?
gesscpg2dy,9431,wow. the light hits it just so and it looks almost fake. very cool.
pd01lxqblk,9432,"i like the coloring but nothing really stands out to me since there are so many pictures like this,"
pqyzzlnqec,9433,colors seem muted. no real punch in the colors. maybe a huesaturation boost and play with the brightnesscontrast some.
qu6l0hr5z3,9434,interesting foto i like the reflexions and colors
iplz3633qe,9435,"ethereal light, nice natural color gradients."
a5zqzvg85f,9436,this is a really good black and white photo but it would have been nicer with a little color

0pokwlbila,9440,very original. i wonder if anyone else has a picture like this. i ike the black and white effect.

sprw6uxlm2,9442,"interesting capture, but the resolution and colors are very weak."
vwiguxn4t8,9443,"seem like alot of green, like maybe the white balance was off, but i like it that way, it makes it more artistic."
vwiguxn4t8,9444,too much green for my tastes. but such a great photograph beautiful.

sn013r1xl9,9448,"not everyone understood this bit of sharp social commentary, but im sure you had expected that."
fgh9pmebci,9449,"image appears a bit soft, not sure i care for the sepia tone."
fgh9pmebci,9450,"i think this picture is a good idea. it is a little hard to see things sort of blend together. i think it might have been better in color, or else more contrast and such."
jpwipygms4,9451,i also wonder if color may have been a better choice for this. i think it would have added something a bit more interesting to look at.
elmwic9kfa,9452,isnt that the truth. great colour
3a242nfxyt,9453,"kind of dark in my screen, nice pic anyway."
3a242nfxyt,9454,clever idea. i wish these was just a touch more light on the grapes
islw5dcb3y,9455,"levels the levels are good, seems to be even throughout the picture, its not over or underexposed, good,"
fv3n4fe78a,9456,there is some strange postprocessing. too much usm?
pqg4x9qg81,9457,nice use of black and white. almost gives a sinister feel to the photo.
oqdlo1sm23,9458,love the vibrant colors. what a great environmental portrait.
doymvg1n4n,9459,so much noise. this had potential.
rxkxv9janw,9460,pretty! i like the misty feeling of this. great capture.
7rzi3s9br3,9461,"nice capture, theres mystery provided by the branches.works for me!"
fk17xpdd9b,9462,"nice, the trees kind of add some distraction though."
fk17xpdd9b,9463,beautiful bw work. love all details. compliments
ho3yc4xqqh,9464,like the shadow and the dark sort of mood i feel in this.
kj4wrtonff,9465,im not really big into blur shots
kb7kajz9up,9466,"i love the misty feel of your image, but for me the borders completely wreck that mood because they are so bold that they dominate"
kb7kajz9up,9467,i think the soft focusprocessing is a little overdone but interesting picture.
4jj61jdfec,9468,what i really like the most in this image is definitely the vintage mood you have created and you did it very well.
cwlb3so5ko,9469,cool! i like this in bw. too bad the building is in the shot.but such is life and photography smiles. nice job.
oy7yj8uobn,9470,"you know your light oliver, wd on hm"

xk1isk3w5f,9472,my pick for the blue. very well conceived and the execution was perfect. excellent job
tlz5hqklps,9473,nice timing and very nice detail!
4u4ttigns9,9474,"wow what whacky branches, great. in my opinion the light is a little bit too harsh."
bpgklpk6zd,9475,"too grainy, and work on color cast."
ys2dv4se9y,9476,fix your white balance please. and use all full or all empty jars if youre going to have them in
ys2dv4se9y,9477,the wn seems to be way off. too much yellowish tone.
s78ysdt562,9478,"a good idea, but perhaps a little lost with the various lines and light and dark areas."
kxyqn4rhw4,9479,"a little more contrast wouldve made this a nice pic, but otherwise looks very tasty!"
nbbpdd1045,9480,saturate more please! there is very little color
81lf3lj2a2,9481,a little more contrast wouldve made this otherwise great picture advertisement grade! nice.
imxbpz3514,9482,neat effect but it makes me think of curious george more than the mona lisa.
lx1rb0o59o,9483,could be a good idea. i dont like the white balance and few sharpness.
30ykt2si1q,9484,"not particularly sharp, underexposed, poor contrast."
30ykt2si1q,9485,im having a hard time seeing what this is. could have benefitted from a little more light unless im missing the intention which is highly possible
30ykt2si1q,9486,very bad noise and color cast.
4yq021khyh,9487,ther is not a lot of contrast in your arrangement. may be a darker bottom would have helped.
h90t6kk4gx,9488,"this is a very nice image, good soft tones and an excellent use of color."
g0dg2ub9j0,9489,"rofl great idea, a little let down by the technicals such as the shadow"
b1wn37z65y,9490,"i think that the there needs to be a little more pop in the colours here, alot of white blending together,"
b1wn37z65y,9491,"maybe its my monitor and im doing you a disservice, in which case i apologise, but this feels washed out and grainy"
tcblj2w0bh,9492,"very nice picture, good light. hope you do well o"
4qw0crc0ch,9493,the matte looks a little fuzzy to me. nice d feel. certainly not a flat image.

mp4wzabbns,9495,beautiful tones and well balanced design elements.
ds8el41enc,9496,"aww, god thats cute d fantastic sharpness and detail too."
ds8el41enc,9497,"my pick for the blue, and comgratulations."
vso1v1f0ib,9498,"looks tasty, but lacking a little in sharpness and contrast."
9p95jlggyf,9499,"excellent photo, but i think parts of it are too overexposed although i might agree that they should be overexposed a little bit. i love the atmosphere, though."
scm47f8iy5,9500,a real appetizing presentation. bright and clear.

ief5dlrps6,9505,clever.bread with a message! great design elements and balance.
6kseoljo0l,9506,edit p.s. i actually really like the flash spillage underneath the toaster.looks more natural and might look odd without

sanrs1ey0n,9511,nice image if the crust was less blurred.
y5ntqht7k5,9512,great detail and textures. wow not one bit of motion blur.
14f1ttkibr,9513,good color contrast on the crust. youre making me hungry! this is how they torture you in restraunts while you wait for your entree.
fdqto45hns,9514,seems to be a bit dark and have uneven light.
25tclc68ta,9515,"shift the color a bit and it looks like one of those photos from mars . hey, wait a minute ."
w2g66tk3hs,9516,i like this image. it has the feel of mystery to it. good job.
56oh6ad28w,9517,i think the white balance might be slightly off here the reds look quite dull.

mtrcuga3xj,9519,"looks yummy! just a little dark on my screen.but, could be just my screen of course."

jrg8ksdl7x,9521,"cute setup, white plates are a little too white but other than that its good."
5etgyza0nj,9522,please dont use flash. natural light would have been nice.
vn1b6vfu0k,9523,"youve captured this pretty well, but is there a yellow cast on the whole picture?"
isui5fffqd,9524,very good clarity and effect from the blur. its tough to get these i know from experience!
isui5fffqd,9525,"a nice motion pic, however not very innovative for me. although more so than the majority of others!"
4w9re3emrp,9526,i think a different color theory would have enhanced this photo.
4w9re3emrp,9527,nice attempt and something unique not fully unique but looks liek you tried well.
02ceky6lip,9528,"it is a wonderful idea very well produced, but why is it bw? it is crying for a touch of yellow!"
9d55osdgat,9529,"this is nice, shame that it is not that clear and the movement is not even"
h47481hjn8,9530,i was kinda suprised you went with this one. i remember really liking one of the others but cant remember now. seems like it was of corey in bw. couldnt be sure though.
kwq0rnmth0,9531,amazing effect and great atmosphere.
kwq0rnmth0,9532,very convincing main light study.
zxoowch7rg,9533,a little dark maybe only my computer reminds me of a fairy tale

opqfuzt8zq,9543,would have been a big hit.better than any other ghost ones i saw.
opqfuzt8zq,9544,cool ghost photo! this came out really nice.
o0tb6y3k4j,9545,an outstanding effort and truly impressive image. very good work!
o0tb6y3k4j,9546,"funny! and this effect works very nicely for patterned subjects like this. i bet it would look great on other subjects as well, perhaps with even more exposure. very nice job!"
s5xqqn2zjj,9547,good use of lights and texture. good technique.
8do5upp6nr,9548,"very cool, i always love black and white macros, its not entirely new though. so ill compromise ."

q9pzgh6qy0,9551,"lastly, it all looks a little dark and muddy on my monitor, but that could be just be."

q9pzgh6qy0,9553,sometimes its important to add a bit more of contrast to the monochromatical photos. nice macro thou.
v8wut5st6k,9554,"dan, you never cease to amaze me. this was my pick for blue. im glad you at least got a yellow to show for your effort."

v8wut5st6k,9556,okay. how did you do it? excellent image. clever and mysterious.
zz4cyc93ts,9557,subtle with colours that create an appealing mystery
zz4cyc93ts,9558,cool because it gives the image that oriental look with the soft hues.

un2prqcx1z,9560,"i like this a lot. shame about the jagged lines, sharpening artifacts?"

od6az6ddrp,9575,amazing colors and the way the light accented edges of the agate
j4jc6ynib4,9576,"sorry, but is has a lot of noise, not very clear, not enough light . my opinion."
j4jc6ynib4,9577,"very phallic, was that your intent? lol the image is neat but flat."
j4jc6ynib4,9578,"grr grain. neatimage would help, and its free."
i1ag0fkuoe,9579,"im not sure if i see how this is a new technique, also, this image is overexposed, leaving much of the detail out of the photo"

ij2jt9bbyd,9592,great idea. nice colors textures. .
ij2jt9bbyd,9593,"pretty unusual the first thing i noticed are the very nice colors. then i wondered if you manipulated this in some way to give it the streaking effects. if so, i would like to see the photo without the streaking."

p5dappjtgi,9605,i really love this photo. the color selection is superb. this photo should clearly be the winner!
pkcw7dhisw,9606,like the lidea that you used i think that by using either color or black and white would have created some more intrest but nice job.
v48ogxnyxw,9607,this is awesome ! the color and tone and light are wonderful !
el8i9e5pre,9608,"nice image, the sharpness and clearity add to this image"
ghwbznl1y9,9609,nice color and clarity good work

m3j3p72vj1,9614,"nice job, it looks very old. i like thesepia tone."
by8sp3pdzr,9615,beautiful colors! brr.looks cold! lovely photo!
7qds0bcmzj,9616,i like the starkness of this picture but find it a bit too underexposed
itwqj46c8m,9617,the sepia tone further reduces what little interest there is in this picture.
mxwsrynnkm,9618,nice setup but a bit overexposed.
mxwsrynnkm,9619,"good photo, i like the idea.its alil blurry"
s9m7qor17n,9620,dont like the bottom need more color

2zxmlpc52f,9622,realy nice photo i like the texture from the trees and the reflections. it almost has a waiting feel about it.

qnhiywwe2p,9628,"pretty sharp, but very dark. swash"
qnhiywwe2p,9629,"if you have software, try playing with the levels to bring out more variation in the tones. this is too dark and somewhat washed out."
qnhiywwe2p,9630,its a bit underexposed. you could adjust the white balance or increase exposure with a few stops to prevent this from happening
efsdycorrb,9631,"beautiful! although the image looks dark and sinister, im just twisted enough to love it."
efsdycorrb,9632,i like the mysterious feel and the nice contrast in this photo. excellent work

7ku1pfujn4,9642,great picture opportunity. the blue is a little.wasteful.
na3h6zj5bu,9643,nice pic. i like the coloring effect you used to make the image seem more fantasylike. good job.
ksmmu7asp1,9644,i really liked this photo.would have been slightly better without the distraction of the cars though. overall.good job
cu3glyvpcy,9645,i think the sepia really enhances the mood and warms what would otherwise be a cold brr picture. nice job.

yqyupf0crk,9647,wow very cool. the black and white effect has a very nice effect on the quality and image of the photo. good job.

2i3mta5ehh,9650,"dont see a good reason for the colour, or removal of colour."
v5bwymeq07,9651,"i dont know if the purple does anything for me, but thats just me!"
v5bwymeq07,9652,"i suppose thats one thing to do with a gray day, but i really dont like the purple. makes it look like a chemical spill or something."
j000b24qbg,9653,"this is a really nice idea, but for me the darkness of the image spoils it somewhat."
2yga6f96ra,9654,this is an interesting image. i really like the softness and the blur. nice work setzler
2yga6f96ra,9655,nice but its alil blurry.

xk3t71k194,9660,i love dis picture its a old touch and the color is nice
t24pacwx2a,9661,could be much better if it were exposed more. there seems to be much detail lost in the darkness of this photo.
t24pacwx2a,9662,"i think this is too dark for my taste, id like to see the detail on the columns"
ihl3jd0c0q,9663,"a little grainy, but still a very cool shot.id be interested to see this in color."
1l7ycym9xi,9664,wonderful lines and contrasts. im glad you kept in in color the subtle color variations help.
31zl55ufye,9665,"bad jpeg quality, cant tell what is going on!"
4i4h37f2a5,9666,using black and white for this photo was a nice idea. i like the texture in this photo.
gl7shmk9j3,9667,nice image. the color effect makes the image look unique and a little bit older. good job.

r9xhtn0v1x,9671,i dont care for the inverted negative colors.
r9xhtn0v1x,9672,"this si a nice print, it would look better if you didnt highlight the edges. but none the less good job,"
owtvyy182r,9673,"this image is so sharp and clear, its beautiful"
owtvyy182r,9674,nice color! perfect winter day
x8e6guwna7,9675,"exposure is a tad dark, but i think its fine. contrast is soft and i like it that way, for this image."
x8e6guwna7,9676,i like the brown toneing in your photo.
h5iaskhjlf,9677,is that misty look genuine? ive seen this type of picture attempted on this competition but i think youve done it better. looks great!
9kvrlgxowt,9678,"nice print quality, good mood conveyed"
a59cu8kc7a,9679,"i really like the date and hour, it add so much to the image balance"
gy0vsod8mn,9680,neat find of course youve probably been driving by it for months in your detour to get to work
6tp0u7t9mb,9681,"your centering is off, color tone is dull"
4fmxlnp18l,9682,"i guess it was a dreary day, how great it would look with more light."
6brr0qepc3,9683,"needs more color saturation, a bit over exposed?"
baj3oyvwdi,9684,love the colours and the mystery in this photo.
712r4t7kat,9685,i like the grain in theis photo and the sepia tone.
5zxttm9i78,9686,lovely and soft feel to the whole picture.
5zxttm9i78,9687,just a great photo. nice blend of colours and that misty look sets it off nicely.
bk4lgj0d1r,9688,"this is sensational! i was a little suspicious of the rather flat grey tones, but now i really think it adds to the serene mood. knockout!"
5xqn6f0cgx,9689,i really like the portray of motion cool
3gphm0a8s6,9690,"i assume you have done a fair bit of tweaking to get those colors, but it sure makes this photo a pleasure to look at."
3gphm0a8s6,9691,a little heavy on the color tweaks
do6eweqont,9692,too dark. longer exposion would have brightened it a bit
kvmn7hoy0o,9693,"im not sure about the desaturation here. id like to see this in colour, i think."
26zlkhtcik,9694,great texture and great shades in the upright sections.
wseite6jtu,9695,beautiful image. nice blueish color.
wseite6jtu,9696,nice masses but too contrasty

zvg9qnva0t,9699,lovely texture and contrasr.
ukgeqt2jgw,9700,"a good, clean black and white image."
ukgeqt2jgw,9701,like the gray tones and the patterns. nice choice of black and white. bol
edhe2aotw2,9702,what amazing photo do you have. unbelivable. but it need a lot of work in contrast
3qcvvwsdhw,9703,lots of neat stuff to look at in this picture.
gvk8cly9s6,9704,"what beautiful graphic quality this has, a superb job"
gvk8cly9s6,9705,i have no just about no idea how you achieved this effect here. the colors and values are so weird. inversion. curves. um. i do hope to get a chance to read about how you did this.
066n6ho9dw,9706,"wow, this is impressive, has a powerful statement"
rcsupaa248,9707,beautiful wonderful treatment of light. one of the best ive seen so far in the competition.
is5bknecli,9708,excellent choice of bw. the contrast is good.
7ex7oksg6c,9709,"nice find, the photograph couldve been better very flat look due to flash"
gzfiv5xhlz,9710,"not bad, but the colors are too ordinary. this would be fine in a brochure, but cant really stand alone."
93514x76mw,9711,"nice, but doesnt seem quite sharp enough. light on the strings is a little harsh."
row4lmkiuj,9712,little too much white. some of the detail lost.
zb16cncna4,9713,the sepia tone is great for this photo.
2ypapknpsb,9714,or the suspense of darkness. very intriguing.
850d8ymm59,9715,what isnt there to like about this? i particularly like the way that the noodles are lit just enough detail.
nmwv7t8l6x,9716,"its a stretch, bridgewise, but a very impressive image anyway."
nrca3v2ba7,9717,"how pretty, i love the lovely mystical quality of your picture."
p6j82t059x,9718,"the colors seem a little weird in this, but somehow i like it. almost a painted feel."
icyy3zqizu,9719,this picture looks a little soft to me. perhaps a touch more sharpening?
epqqwtbw5e,9720,too obvious attempt for the brown
e85285fx2x,9721,they are a bit too dark and a bit too big in the picture.
p6gu80hhlx,9722,"its a little overexposed. you may have been going for that effect to enhance the feel of desertion, though. i personally would have liked it less washed out."
p6gu80hhlx,9723,"wow. something really whacky happened to this one, im afraid. its all washed out and lacks contrast. not sure what you may have done to accomplish that."
xwokl58qzc,9724,great idea. too dark. and i have a bright lcd monitor. im sure for some itll be even darker.
avroh19ufm,9725,nice shot.i really like the color cast you gave to it. kinda spooky and surreal.
2b77syau1n,9726,seems to be a lot of green. g
6n3sk8y7a4,9727,"to me, this looks to be too soft nothing that a little sharpening wouldnt fix."
o733xfdkbi,9728,great color amongst grey!
1jda9wl9wg,9729,i like bw photos with good contrast. i like yours a lot.
pyzyc27fxf,9730,"great idea, too blurry for my taste"
olc3cs43wx,9731,personal opinion.white balance seems off.
r91429egc9,9732,was thinking a little of the same about your blue ones gary. trade ya yellow for a red lol
8dmkqolxyl,9733,nice job with the shutter.too much darkness here for me.
1mhg9g8du9,9734,"pretty good colors, not a bad photo."
h43468kn2t,9735,the way the lights work and their colors makes this a very appealing image. good work.
hru4y3tec0,9736,i am in favor of the dark as well! great job on being different from the others that were entered here!
hru4y3tec0,9737,"nice idea and comp, but a little to dark."
6uws9njauq,9738,"colors, lights, angles. very nice"
sergzkix0w,9739,great picture. clever desaturation.
sergzkix0w,9740,the desaturation to bring out the blue and red make this picture work.
sergzkix0w,9741,seems a little hazy or washed out. curves or contrast? very nice image though!
f6pwzn78dg,9742,lovely colors. i like the way the boats ad more life to the image!
i1puh4fepo,9743,nice atmosphere. a bit muddy perhaps but thats probably what you intended. love the reflections and the handful of lights.
i1puh4fepo,9744,a bit more light and it would be interesting.now its too dark to see. maybe longer exposure would halp.
ql4hmemca5,9745,great photo! not much else i can say! amazing atmosphere! excellent!
7awph9iflt,9746,great idea but the quality of the photo is not great.
k8x9qmtvhf,9747,there is an ephemeral quality to this well done
rwmtzwypzu,9748,bleak picture. the sepia effect really works well.
knxqsjiabv,9749,why not use natural light? the flash is too harsh.
kiultpp8fv,9750,less blurring and more straightening might have helped here.
kiultpp8fv,9751,"i like this because its different, and its got a nice p.o.v. i think if the levels had been messed with a little it could have really popped in its color and be a better photo, but not bad."
zbqqe2tz99,9752,must have been taken during the labour party conference. the yellow coats spoil a nice picture
tmt748vdq3,9753,neat balance between straight lines and interesting curves with that little bit of the modern again a traditional entity
unuu6agq6c,9754,this is a good image with lots of detail and colour. i feel that a little extra sharpening would make it even better.
yd4do5v6s8,9755,"very nice vivid colors, which i was there now. looks like i could enjoy it, nice work."
kpuvw11lvv,9756,im not an expert but the picture looks a litlle fuzzy
rms8dssk8m,9757,"thats the christo thing in orange, isnt it? i love how you showed the delicate detail in the bridgework."
hcjqcd62cm,9758,"so far this is an original idea. i havent seen any other pics of just the bridges shadow, and ive rated about . nice job."
o9puwna5ag,9759,awesome color and light. great capture!
o9eyaeruw3,9760,this is a great self portrait. i love the color tone also! very nice!
eboj6chjak,9761,"color is brilliant, seems almost sureal."
9gl4tafegv,9762,i like this but think it would look better if you used curves to bring out more detail in the dark areas
j3nles14eb,9763,"a superbly bright image, only lacking, i feel, in a little sharpness."
dtn5vxtnx6,9764,any idea what the white streaks are planes?
o8lw7wi363,9765,wonderful light and very dreamish effect. good work.
wd2rvdeae2,9766,i wonder what that would look like if humans didnt exist. would it be different? perhaps more blue. perhaps not
1owc4hzpyv,9767,"good job catching the shadows, but somehow they dont immediately stand out. maybe a boost in contrast?"
150q9zvoq6,9768,this looks amazing.perfect exposure timing!
150q9zvoq6,9769,"eerily foreboding. this looks unreal, but i sure do like it! what great complimentary colors, too."
4t5tjbgitb,9770,"darn the red sign shouldnt be there, at least not in its present state."
a743a3rw8h,9771,"too overly bright on white towers. but if fixed, would all the other lovely colors suffer? this just has a really pretty feel to it."
izjjdt4agc,9772,nice motion blur on the antennae to show the things not quite dead yet.
lz597cnbi6,9773,the colors and weight of each section dont seem to balance
dolne5lqk1,9774,youve captured a great mood in the tradition of many famous ny nighttime shots.well done.
ov4xld38ou,9775,bw was an excellent choice for this photograph. wonderful tones.
e04ua6b2a9,9776,i honetstly cannot believe that this image did not win the blue. i just saw the results of the competition and i think this was the winner by far. beautiful.
m5l3xm5xvy,9777,"leaving the sign in is a decision i wouldnt have made. excellent colors, nice exposure,"
91c7b585o9,9778,good quality bw picture. just pitty about those electric wires.
803hja713f,9779,ir picture? i dont know if it appeals to me in this photograph. wonder what it would of looked like in color. you have a lot of dark areas here.
803hja713f,9780,bw does wonders for this oneit really brings out the shapes.
2t4bk73ico,9781,hate to be technical but . what a perfect exposure! has to be a .
c0demke73k,9782,"good contrast.snow is too bright, seems overexposed!"
fkyii07kag,9783,"a dark and messy photo, and there is only two generations here."
fkyii07kag,9784,"looks too dark and i hope its not my monitor. a little too much clutter too, distractions all around."
45ubfib2hs,9785,it looks like your bw conversion was just a desaturate?
45ubfib2hs,9786,desaturate seems to wash out detail and i see this here. if i am wrong i apologise however there still is detail lacking here
wqkz7jw3vv,9787,"lovely picture with lots of texture, although maybe the walls could be made a little more prominent, as they are a bit too dark for me at present."
cjwiekinxe,9788,"blues are way oversaturated otherwise, nice picture."
4okfxn9z6w,9789,really nice picture. contrast and texture are very good!
qyeig4t7wc,9790,bright lights allways do well.
qyeig4t7wc,9791,for som reason im getting a matrix vibe from this photo. very cool.
2emzjos5hy,9792,"clean, sharp and beautiful tones make this an outstanding image."
2emzjos5hy,9793,great lines and shapes here. good choice for black and white.
pdt7xm8j57,9794,there seems a general air of softness here perhaps an extra final sharpen after downsizing
t1gzjl5iwa,9795,"fine, fine job, awesome contrast,"
yrp9s7qpss,9796,great light and nice sparkles
s4g0j4m8e4,9797,"possibly a little oversaturated, but a great image nonetheless"
j7aaippi7m,9798,nice bw. good job on the contrast.
31wh24jqim,9799,"great contrast, stark and commanding"

2056si1nd6,9803,"great color, great photo. nice job."
yrkd42nuo2,9804,"like the idea, but the colors are too washed out and a little grainy for my taste."
spxcs3owzi,9805,"i like the setting,im thinking the image is rather fuzzy, sharpened too much maybe?"
zv6spitkz7,9806,"a lightning? very good, nice touch on the cianotype, great capture!"
zv6spitkz7,9807,very cool! love the feel the desaturation offers.
zv6spitkz7,9808,wow! the contrast seems to create tons of drama! i like this picture very much
714gypxzz9,9809,"subtly beautiful. a real elegance to this, and i love the softness."
c0for9zc9c,9810,cant agree of the overly blur effect. if its sharper then it will be great!
lyyrmsodso,9811,"this is really unique, great shapescolors here."
bydg3kaka2,9812,i get the feeling id love this if the colors were natural as a negative image it doesnt work for me.
bydg3kaka2,9813,reversed colors to give the image a real eerie feel of triumph.
bydg3kaka2,9814,i never have and never will truly appreciate shots that are treated with this type of psychedelic coloring.
4sdt68svry,9815,"perfect tonality and texture. really, really nice. my favourite so far."
3tlpmfjtjs,9816,nice dark mood with interesting shadows and lines.
9usndud4g9,9817,i really like the texture and colors of this photo. has a real freakish techno vibe.
8sh4vlzj58,9818,a captivating blend of softness and clarity with a masterly use of light.
w7x7h8enr7,9819,"for some reason that greasy, salty mess has made me hungry.mm."
rqycddct9v,9820,nice idea and better execution. im not sure i like the red color though. good job.
rqycddct9v,9821,"cool photo, the light is maybe just a bit harsh."
gmj5p7hl4z,9822,"technical , looks like some compression artifacts in the green areas"
gmj5p7hl4z,9823,"incredible background,young colors, stopped time effect"
n9o3v4ztau,9824,"appeal , not fond of orange"
buvhctpe5e,9825,"grainy, makes me think more of beaten or abused rather than heartbroken. good foto."
xexiqakixb,9826,"this however, is my personal taste and in no way reflects on the quality of the image.very nice work."
ulqen7kan8,9827,"i need some ghost of detail in the black areas, please."
123djfiw71,9828,"this photo at first glance is quite good, but on a closer inspection several points come to light"
6eeogj9ybd,9829,"very good quality technically, not very interesting otherwise."
qiamx65ckz,9830,"excellent color, the words could be a little sharper."
rg49r6onsy,9831,"imo this photo could have been edited slightly, levels adjusted, contrast added, to have made it qquite more spectacular than it is."
ckblxdcrz5,9832,dont think i like the color choice.green clashes with brown.
uo91yimgq0,9833,i like the dark finish of this photo. the duotone does well.
4iyhfb3387,9834,more dead than broken. nice bw and good comp.
kd6q2nsdbf,9835,"great object. i like the bw effect, texture and shadows. well done!"
rvwrsr5ibn,9836,nice use of vivid primary colors.
6szj6rxf2e,9837,quite original and unique. gotta give you a for creativity and humor.
6szj6rxf2e,9838,"heheh, good stuff. bw would give it an interesting retro scifi feel i think"
6szj6rxf2e,9839,"very neat pic. not sure ifhow this was done under the rules, but cool non the less."
zdy7a7emj9,9840,i love the way you lit this. the yellow highlight and the colours together look great.
rah6hn9d89,9841,"interesting take, and one of the few good uses of selective desat."
rah6hn9d89,9842,"excellent, nice touch with the desat and tissues."
qgdzq9tsuq,9843,ok image but too heavy on the sharpening
bvan2v6ne4,9844,the softness of the picture makes me feel sorry for this rusted thing that has probably seen many wars.
osd4rnp79s,9845,"great colors and situation, lets your imagination work."
eru13zxcg9,9846,great image with beautiful sharpness and no noise.
j1wsj1me04,9847,love it and in colour . goodness you are the photographer of my dreams!
3o89jvqg72,9848,"the shadows are a bit harsh, but the sharpness is great."
bvoo92xvjk,9849,that looks as though its taken a battering.maybe its my monitor but image does look rather too dark
p4a9vrbwrn,9850,"why am i seeing a fetus in this? lol. to be serious, i think its a little hard to recognize this as an orange maybe because of the harsh light?"
p4a9vrbwrn,9851,looks like the highkey effect has been applied too strongly that this has affected the detail of the orange.
p4a9vrbwrn,9852,very bright try to darken your image next time.
s9ofb4ksrz,9853,hi. i like the creepy feel of the picture. would be better if it were a bit larger so i could make out the detail.

n1a2w5j0aa,9855,"i think this is just adorable. i love the colors. love them. i would buy a print of this, for sure. great work."
n1a2w5j0aa,9856,"wow, looking forward do reading about how you did that one, great exposure, id give it an , minus for taking picture of something thats not already broken"
ni5bkoymoa,9857,an interesting study in texture and light and subtle coloring.i love the down turned chair.nice work.

787dr3f7vp,9859,nice detail. color and shadows are nice.
snxp7crgv4,9860,hi. great colors here. the trees make it a little too busy for my taste.
wowz5zi5ox,9861,"very flat, some more work with levelscurves could really improve it i think."
jeduirkk73,9862,i think it could use just a little brightnesscontrast to boost the highlights a tad and bring out more detail. maybe a dash of usm as well.
2qh7bywy0b,9863,"wow, great b and w, contrast and texture.hope this does well for you"
2qh7bywy0b,9864,hi. nice texture and mood to this photo.

j3q62miwef,9871,"with the limited light, a much longer exposure would have made this jump out much more."
v7pbrqvhyd,9872,"a little creepy, but i really love the colors and textures! good work."
6phu9lb8wr,9873,"this stands out as unique, but could be a little sharper. good comp and original. taking off a little for sharpness, but not much."

zx83mq0nrp,9875,"very beautiful imagery, the black and white really work for this. this is a feat for basic editing"

76hl3wn1nn,9877,"a little bit too much contrast, but an excellent idea."
uqu2gzazea,9878,oops! good processing an use of pastel effect.

5otbd7ihau,9881,very dark might be my monitor. will give you the benefit of the coubt.
e408lmr787,9882,"this is my kind of picture. rich wonderful light, tones, textures and lines."
wwq0xdbnmx,9883,"whaat. wow. it makes me want to just look at it. i usually dont like fake looking pictures, but this one is just so interesting. i loove the white on white, and the sharp yellow not too much, not too little. the only negative i can see is that these are not already broken, but who really cares, anyway. from me."
wwq0xdbnmx,9884,i would have prefered it with more yellow stuff. and a bit less bright.
3i7kjpnss3,9885,beautiful colors of the skies. nice and stark.

kcpcr4x98u,9889,instinctive shadow wonder if it was planned this way? sad
1i6iuwcj6q,9890,i really like this and what it says. the bw was good to do with this. lots of stories to go with this.
jglb0h4bjz,9891,"oh dear! bit dark around the edges, i feel"
kp7mtxjmla,9892,"i see very cool color and nice lines, but dont get the broken in this image, maybe just old."
6kcjrxytir,9893,"now im usually against gratuitous bw, not here. this is perfect, niccely subdued and contrasted to show just enough to make me interested and qwant more. you have a talent."
utv6vrkonq,9894,i like this a lot. esp. the red.

cx1p8d641h,9899,wonderful. love the leading line and the greens and yellow tones. very pretty.
j941mfypl5,9900,i think this photo would have looked better in colors and closer to the objektbarn.
xdt40orcwl,9901,i doubt it lost any points for the oversharpening but thats just about all you could find wrong with it.
xdt40orcwl,9902,nice doc! congrates on your first real time blue!
q06gpf9wz8,9903,"this has been well thought out, and also taken really well. i think you should be very happy with this image, as i also give it the wow factor. i really love the dustydirty appearance, as it gives it an ageing quality."
hja3zs8e83,9904,the clarity in this image and the capture of the motion do it for me.
hja3zs8e83,9905,"wow! i love the use of color, motion, etc! great treatment of an idea that could easily be cliche."
jvc96d5jau,9906,"add a bit more contrast and sharpness and you have a winner, i think."
0tgk5n4fon,9907,very interesting. the grain is a nice effect.
ggx2z7bsun,9908,perfect choice of colour. would have been better if the broken dials were sharper
ggx2z7bsun,9909,nice light and tones.harkens to another era and simpler times.well done.
mpm95r6m02,9910,oh nice take on this classic photo!
mpm95r6m02,9911,now this is a clever twist on bens original love filter idea! clever one!
mpm95r6m02,9912,"reminds me very much of blue ii, still good photo, but not original anymore"
9jq3mnc92t,9913,"the pink light is lovely, though it does not deliver a broken feeling at all"

qrjckm5n6j,9942,nice work! it is just a bit too dark for me towards the bottom.
untwaci83s,9943,"i think this would be better without all the neat image you used. i like to see the real detail, especially in something as detailed as dead leaves."

9ecrh21max,9998,whoa. the brown of the browns. something metaphysical going on here
9ecrh21max,9999,whatt! very little and very dark. cant really make anything out.
9ecrh21max,10000,going for the brown in the the brown challenge?
ienmmh5ffb,10001,kind of grainy and not a lot of contrast. i cant locate the original brownie to compare it to.

qbrmyfn6ec,10005,well done! i prefer more contrast bewteen lights darks
qbrmyfn6ec,10006,"no similarities to the original except for the color. technical quality is way better, though, but lightinh could be enhanced"

f350xwtvx5,10008,"in comparison to the original that was selected to redoimprove, etc.i like your version of it. much improved for clarity and detail."
w8kheg3m0s,10009,ahh. nicely done. i find your interpretation to be much more appealing with the softness and darker areas. not sure many took the time to compare the original.
lvp4ux5xzs,10010,"hmm, i think a photo filter or less intense orangewhite contrast would have done better. improvement over the original though, id like to see this processed slightly different, i think it has real potential"

7z4uzb2h54,10032,"looks seriously overprocessed, but im not sure if the look was intended or not. gives it a bit of a cartoony look that i find interesting."

tzjtnrsfwx,10057,not such a big improvement over the brown original.
097553swv7,10058,"its a mistake to think that including an object in some way makes it a better picture, because by including the object you denature the purity of charlies depiction by giving us nothing but plain green, he forces us to absorb his image on precisely his own terms."

qpohpozoga,10085,at last some edge! great idea.
yijhems5q3,10086,"wow. when i first look at this photo, the bubbles look like miniature hot air balloons rising into the air! great colour!"
7em3bsf45n,10087,interesting capture and i really like the soothing colors.

q19tl3ff63,10100,"very good. the composion is good, and so is the light."
l4n423ubh9,10101,"nice idea, but way overexposed. if you have an exposure compensation you might have used it to correct the problem"
j4t1iwdwor,10102,definitely unique method for blowing bubbles.
lilyzxyg8m,10103,i like this picture. the colors are nice and its not overflowing with bubbles like some of the other pictures with beverages in them.

x2v5zeaayr,10107,incredible picture! love the shapes and textures here. colors work well.
nvgy0egu38,10108,a little too dark for me i would prefer the outlines of the bubbles to be a little more clearly defined.
y0kgpf20ur,10109,"i wish the two flash spots werent so overwhelmingly white, but the reflections are very cool."
o43l2jwbes,10110,"nice job. i like the softness of this photo, but maybe more bubbles would be better?"

skm6b24xas,10130,nice but suffers from general unsharpness.

4uzkmygvml,10136,"im not sure why you chose to represent this image in monochrome, particularly purple."
4uzkmygvml,10137,i feel like the purple hue kind of washes out the interest in the photo. could have used a little more contrast i think with this color treatment.
4uzkmygvml,10138,the color dont realy work good. how a pity! could be a very nice pic!

agbcfwyrmx,10143,its such an awsome image . all those amazing reflections and then its just so good to look at with the fantastic colours and sharpness . it reminds me of escher for some reason . maybe for all the different views and unusual perspectives created by the bubbles . wow . !

ftprfaedo4,10157,"this image is blurry, but nice try!"
0afagwpwrw,10158,"the colors work well here the predominant greens and browns go with the mood, and the splash of complementary purple adds some excitement. i think the photo could work even better in black and white, but thats really a personal choice."
0afagwpwrw,10159,great shoy i really like this one. the reflections are the real highlight.

rnu186uybc,10169,"neat picture, great idea. the black really makes the bubbles stand out."
1avh5q8972,10170,this seems to be very odd im not really sure what it is but yea. nice bubbles
lkpsqozmfq,10171,the coloring in this photo makes those not appear as bubbles to me.

m5aq0b81pt,10315,reminder burst of colour was the topic

jcsaavwuqi,10331,"wow, your flowers are just exploding with color. i love how you used the glossen blur to create that effect. you did some great editing there. i think that this is such a beautiful image, absolutely love the colors and arrangement of the flowers. very, very professional looking."

auyr9ehvew,10337,"oh and by the way, we had a purple desoto that my mother inherited from an aunt and guess what we called it?"
1c8fgjv3hl,10338,amazing image. i would be interested in knowing how you got the exposure so pefect in an image with such widely varying levels.

6yl2xmn3jq,10344,the color play nicely versus the endearing silhouttes. gorgeous!
b7g5hgk8kf,10345,"definately a burst of color here, but the feeling of the whole image is a bit dark."
b7g5hgk8kf,10346,dont like the use of desat here. the leaves look like someone spray painted them.
5pb3o44xso,10347,great colors and details here. your choice to desaturate the photo worked well. nice job.
5pb3o44xso,10348,dont think the desat was needed. it would have done just fine on its own. very colorful fishy!
hffzfqrba4,10349,lacks sharp detail and punch
ygkdfzpacw,10350,maybe its because the handle is pink and the blades are green rather than the silverblackchrome things that i am used to?
ygkdfzpacw,10351,its okay but the color isnt bursting out at me
0k0n5bxpwf,10352,"good idea, and a clear sharp image as well."

81b7ovjozu,10357,not quite sure about the colors. the yellow is very muted with a greenish tint. could be warmed a bit.
bakckfg7wr,10358,"nice arrangement, and image clear and sharp."
bakckfg7wr,10359,"i like your idea. the red, blue and green buckets are so dark now they have lost their definition. the green one especially seems to be kind of.floating."
eqykcv7l4k,10360,"good idea but the colors seem a bit muted, may want to boost the sat or contrast a bit"
gdap9s4c9w,10361,"good choice of colors, but for me its still the splash that speaks, not the colors."

8hzwwsga9z,10363,i think blue is more of a burst here than buildings . pastel colors.

dmbyey9rrh,10369,"not enough bursting of color i bet alot have said. well, im saying it too,"
dmbyey9rrh,10370,"additional saturation to pop out the reds may have been effective, additionally some oversharpening may have helped give this a surreal effect."

cips2dnp86,10605,seen more light on the statues front.
wl89gnht3i,10606,too soft and unnatural for me. but really not a bad pic.
wl89gnht3i,10607,"beautiful softness, such a peacefulcalming feel to it. i could see it in a portraiture calendar."
359bgruxkr,10608,beautiful colors and nice balance to this picture.
j3f1aqus86,10609,the colors are nice but photo needs to have more impact. maybe fewer liimbs but larger.
xwxem68zbt,10610,"like the softness and treatment of the image, conveying the gentle touch."
xwxem68zbt,10611,"very daring, sensual image. it seems to be well balanced, softness ads a romantic feeling."
sxav1rs064,10612,there is a lot to like about this photo. it looks a little overprocessed with the unnatural halos around the areas that had not been burned.
3i7t1cnkef,10613,"nice setup, but a little to static, and too much white around the leaves."
7gwa2zfw30,10614,"also using an external source of light would help. sory if im wrong, but i think you used flash and that makes the pic flat."
7zkmmfh5ri,10615,"the blur effect is too obvious to be effective here, sorry."
wfbdiqlcvt,10616,"your color play is, to say the least, magnificent."
yfsfsvvu0p,10617,"the colour could use a mild boost, especially the greens."
srcxzdehn3,10618,the roses are maybe a bit dark but good idea !
mesyyhnsyd,10619,looks dreamy and the colors are great.
10tefidoq9,10620,looks overexposed or something imo. just seems a bit off for some reason.
10tefidoq9,10621,"too bad about all the iso colour noise, makes the image a bit flat but this is a good image, not great however but above average imo."
js5ypiwnaf,10622,bit too dull for my tastes colour vise needs a litle more sparkle
y4wmdu18j2,10623,"nice idea. for this to work effectively, you could think about brightening the image and using selective blur to mystify the effect a bit."
8x8lnvbjjv,10624,color of the drik does not look to tasty. nice setup.
8x8lnvbjjv,10625,"nice arrangement! the lights caused hotspots in several places though. might have been a good idea to diffuse the light . but thats just me, and what do i know?"
8jglla38bh,10626,great capture of the waters motion.
0ydr49ezi2,10627,it is my monitor or is there a yellow cast to the image?
mz3vb1sv6i,10628,im sort of contrast crazy. ill make an effort not to use it so much.
uk7d2qu1l1,10629,"the colors are a bit muted, but thats not nessarally a bad thing. i like the lines."
mtssn4cvzh,10630,"something kinda haunting here, which really adds to the mood!"
mtssn4cvzh,10631,"slightly oversharpened imo, but nice use of color and mood to create a representation of november"
mtssn4cvzh,10632,beautiful on any calender. color scheme is really great.
pm45887t76,10633,"from what youve put down as digital processing, i cant see any glaring problems. a good use of usm, as the image doesnt seem too oversharp, and i cant tell where youve cloned or smudged."
zvmk4mgdyk,10634,"edit added actually, its not that much of a contrast, you have quite a few images that are very graphic in nature. i like your photos very much."
iqbor5cd7n,10635,too many soft image haters out there.ive found to my cost!
iqbor5cd7n,10636,i wish there were a bit more yellow leaves to contrast the reds.
qynmo5f0bw,10637,a little busy but great colours and light.
qeenqy8z00,10638,you should do a whole calendar of carved apples. i think the iso added some beautiful textures. great piece!
qeenqy8z00,10639,really novel idea. i like the color tone too.
ki61z8auwg,10640,nicely done though the lashes seem almost sharp enough to be scary nice glow to the image.
ki61z8auwg,10641,pushes the limits of light and could have been a horrible garish flop but you managed to keep it under control.
q47r5dp457,10642,the colors are nice but there is some serious artifacting and pixellation going on here.
q47r5dp457,10643,a real riot of colour. busy but nice.
q47r5dp457,10644,"beautiful riot of colors, but it has an over processed look. it certainly does say july."
3b6png4zx7,10645,the bright lights in this photo are beautiful. i like the shpae and lines in the photo as well.
3b6png4zx7,10646,"it is an interesting building, but its a little too soft for my tastes."
4x0qy54dhi,10647,"nice and sharp, color contrast is vivid, love the reds and the pastel blues."
4x0qy54dhi,10648,"very well done. i like it very much. id like to see what it would look like with the reds saturated a little moreit seems pale it didnt affect my scoring at all, just curious."
20094tpwlj,10649,i love the use of color. there are about different blues and a few different greens and they go very well together.
tpx2hm5m5u,10650,too much postprocessing for my taste.
tpx2hm5m5u,10651,"some haloing in the trees, but a stunning image hdr? nevertheless."
szg3pxi1yj,10652,the movement from all the tracks is great!
w7ifjn6buq,10653,nice capture of the bird.these birds are hard to get a good color on.they are so dull in color to begin with
psa5f3xuvx,10654,something about the processing makes this one hard for me to look at this otherwise very beautiful image. too much sharpening maybe?
e7hy9gm2w4,10655,this has a definite nostalgic feel to it. the bw treatment works very well here. i could very well see this in a calendar.
e7hy9gm2w4,10656,is this a hdr? really like the tones.will be very interested in your pp notes
qc6wil2tez,10657,very nice. seems slightly underexposed whites seem a little dark.
b4z7u7es1q,10658,"such pretty colors, nothing is pushed to far.very good"
lsbu4qc500,10659,i think this is really flat for a night photo.
djmkbjgzvq,10660,you are truly a loving warm person with a big heart.love shez
10rvj41i3b,10661,sweet car.just a little dark in the processing.
894eleewtw,10662,"congratz, very nice photo . only the gray line is not by my taste"
36oejclk3d,10663,"personally, the purple against the black makes the photo look dull.and i know it isnt.the colors do look very velvety"
webotijmgc,10664,try a version of this in black and white. it might stand out more since there is not much color to this photo.
1t2sj5y7ui,10665,dont like what the hdr did to her forehead.also a bit dark
9ciyw2joie,10666,"i think i had these figurines at one time.they really stand out on the black background.focus is really good, nice detail"
p4xkstmc4o,10667,a little too much red for my liking.
p4xkstmc4o,10668,really like the colors in your shot.but you almost took the color to far.nice capture
julfy103db,10669,"this pickture has a great balance to it, i love the colors."
zvoaeptnj5,10670,lots of crystals.burr this from someone in the south! looks a little grainy to me
zvoaeptnj5,10671,"i cant see it in a calendar. its a little dark to me. even though i generally like abstracts, i dont relate to your image. sorry."
zrf9dtlvgj,10672,"soft tones, beautiful setting, wish i was there now!"
17y74us533,10673,love the tones and the texture of your shot.great edit
1ncg72au4c,10674,"oh wow, excellent . would be better in my opinion without those gray lines"
1ncg72au4c,10675,"really nice exposure, great tones"
qacekwq9d9,10676,"beautiful image, lovely soft colors with such details and textures. lovely and what a great placement!"
qacekwq9d9,10677,i love how all the colors in the photo get darker near the bottom of the photo
z3e4v1zr77,10678,"i dont much see the movie character, this photo is frightening i would have used grayscale."
5q8ht04qay,10679,perfect colors for the month of october
5q8ht04qay,10680,beautifully lit. good colour balance. pity one of the leaves is soo badly damaged.
5q8ht04qay,10681,"beautiful exposure and light, almost perfect!"
vzp4ss4n0w,10682,i just wish i will seeing a little more natural color out of the roses.
3i9svp1lmw,10683,"wonderful picture, very clever, great idea and sharp."
7justbviem,10684,"this is a beautiful building, just a little flat in color and tone.more curveslevels? where is this"
t61cbto13g,10685,the white of the flowers blasts out the other colors and tones.needs more balance
d1ejqikyvv,10686,"i think this is hdr.nice colors, everything compliments, not over done"
hizzlm981f,10687,a tad bit washed out. not a good balance of lights and darks which i dont think really help this photo.
hizzlm981f,10688,"neat idea.the white is almost to bright with those pale, pale legs."
04vrodafds,10689,the texture on the leaves gives it the rough feeling and look to it. good picture.
j4s2ni4q5v,10690,very nice capture. great colors and detail.
j4s2ni4q5v,10691,wonderful capture.i like the color the the bw cow.guess when you have an itch you have to find someone to scratch.
j4s2ni4q5v,10692,rare to see such a color contrast and variety!
ei76ibk9dn,10693,"this is so orange that i have to ask myself how much more orange could this be? and the answer is none. none more orange. i may bump ya, but its an for now."
ei76ibk9dn,10694,finally a picture that is phenomenally executed and has a appropriate month. red october totally get it!
ykw5biv7p5,10695,cute little penguin.photo is a little dark
puwbbwf753,10696,"oh my, the glum whiteness of january. i dig it."
puwbbwf753,10697,"nice cat,a little light on my screen."
l4w9t1n0fx,10698,"great capture, nice warm colours."
l4w9t1n0fx,10699,"i enjoy the rich, warm brown colors and the different textures in this image. good job!"
ms9p3zyklp,10700,"a bit too heavy on the saturation for my taste, otherwise a pleasant photograph."
y1byizrsdr,10701,a bit more saturation would have added warmth to the pic
7s7efrp8wg,10702,"a warm, soft and delicate dream."
a2bmh5vwgz,10703,"i would give this an but it has some sort of green tint color on it. ha, just kidding!"
i34gxu1py2,10704,"wonderful pov, the light source is amazing."
tgzlgmd4ye,10705,"simply beautiful. the flowers color is very rich, i love it."
40cabe9d3i,10706,very close finish! it does have that warm feeling of september.
09xhi1f7gm,10707,something great about the tones here the gray the blue so nice! great contrast and texture to the pavers.
iu3st7fpqh,10708,love that bug! great colors
223jtvqtja,10709,nice tribute to anne geddes. needs a tad more sharpness to make the grade.
jhniazd8n7,10710,my kind of blur clive.
jhniazd8n7,10711,mystery in a dream of color.
jhniazd8n7,10712,starting to like this type of image more and more. lovely colors.
q2d9nnpfhv,10713,this is cute but looks way too dark and im not fond of the selective desaturation and muted colour either.
2it4suz8bh,10714,black and white is good i like to give pictures like this a slight bluish casttint especially in the white areas to make it look colder.
d9lhs4ghvp,10715,.not stylish with black buckie.
iz018g9qpt,10716,looking for a norwegian blue? 
st8m5gm6h6,10717,"very nicely done, great exposure, great color, and great visual effect!"
y5b12t6kal,10718,"fun idea. it feels that there is a good amount of noise here, and that the color is off. i think if those two things were changed, i would have liked it even more."
fikit3ls75,10719,"very clever idea, good creativity. nice sharpness and detail"
cm75vuak28,10720,wow . this is fantastic . love the imaginative approach and the quality of the image . im thinking this would look great with the blue . this should help get you there . !
7aywvdu95j,10721,"dohh! ghost rider, you should know better! at least it looks like its just a canon"
wv7ui5aqnz,10722,wonder what theyre going to do on their honeymoon? neat idea.
d1646z36s6,10723,a wonderful image showing masterful control of light and shadows. way to go! i love it.
g2ijzr5h7j,10724,beautiful blur. too much competition for the brown this time. members of my team outbrowned you!
iylurgmxk1,10725,i wonder if you changed you ev value to make it blur? this would cause it you need to increase your exposure time and decrease isoincrease fstop to ensure thiungs dont over expose persumeing your on manual
o4r5vpczs6,10726,wonderful capture of motion very energetic colors!
5m19cn2kyj,10727,this is a very cool image. its blurred but everything stands out so clearly. nice job there deb.
5m19cn2kyj,10728,"wtg, deb. the bw makes this perfect. excellent stuff!"
5m19cn2kyj,10729,great stuff deb. the bw is perfect here. very well done.
5m19cn2kyj,10730,wot an amazing look this image has deb . just wonderful . its just so incredible artistic . love the bw . just perfect in every way .

ywyc3veh13,10733,"moody and smooth, lovely browns"
ywyc3veh13,10734,theres a peacefulness to this. very nice use of the light here.
vogu1c0cj9,10735,love the brilliant colors! it feels like im traveling at warp speed
yehh68vcf0,10736,i cant figure out whether the black section is beneficial or not.
gr7elxdvt1,10737,gorgeous! i love the mood. is it a negative exposure?
05pxz53ehc,10738,"out of the many blurred photos taken out auto windows, sometimes ya get one that seems hypnotic and magical!"
05pxz53ehc,10739,"sensuous, brown and stark."
05pxz53ehc,10740,"great technique, love the motion on the trees."
wghi5i3117,10741,"great movement, colour and comp!"
fn8j4dxxh5,10742,"the yellow dominates this picture a little too much. it may benefit from some more browns, reds and blue to balance it out."
fn8j4dxxh5,10743,perhaps a little too much blur and its almost like a big smudge in places.
qfl3hdqwnt,10744,"excellent movement. there is something about the contrast that i dont like, but the movement and lines created are exceptional."
6d79fce1zs,10745,thats interesting and good movement technique.
2nexch0blg,10746,this is amazing . fantastic image with such incredible shapes and movement . love the overlayed look too .
t90l0ggknq,10747,"lovely, evocative image. great, subtle use of movement!"
t90l0ggknq,10748,the exposure does seems a bit off though. the bright areas are a bit blown out. maybe too much contrast?
2qd5hqi3zi,10749,nicely done. the colors are really rich and the motion is quite evident here.
ww7aqx4tvm,10750,and lovely picture! the detail in the blur is beautiful.
ww7aqx4tvm,10751,fantastic image irene and well deserved blue
he9qsert89,10752,"whatever you do, dont mess with thor! cool fella."
8clwup6jvt,10753,"this reminds me of katee and rozs editing. regardless, superb pov and i just adore the graininess."
ccs0vg2sg0,10754,very cool graphic quality. nice job.
a4kxbcf1c3,10755,i like the busy feel to this and the color and processing really go well with this.
zx2ffp259i,10756,nice detail. i think the yellow cast hinders the quality a bit.
f4q01o7pb9,10757,"wow.very sharp, no need google to see."
urlrbov5br,10758,that look of concentration. she must enjoy her job! im thinking that all the blur suggests there is so much going on and she works very quickly.
3pu7dc75x5,10759,processing really looks cool. a tad bit grainy for my taste but that just might be the limits of your device.
00d0mfipgf,10760,love all the grain in this one as well as the tones.
yx3haxh0pv,10761,"excellent picture, great job with the filter. looks awesome !"
x0v7rilqo6,10762,nice work! my pick for the blue
x0v7rilqo6,10763,"as far as cameras in phones go, this is the best ive seen so far. im so used to saturated colors, that i mightve upped that ante a smidge, but its really well done. nice one"
7h0prwuyx5,10764,"a bit too busy, but the bw conveys the dreary feeling, would have been great without the boats."
9f74lyi6gv,10765,wonderful lines and bw conversion. i so want this to be bigger!
ui93rlvjp8,10766,"moody, sharp, very nice i like your postprocessing!"
4rvs2pgod0,10767,"beautiful, dark, great feel. this is a ten."
u5o1lgfb2h,10768,very original. great colors and great find.
p60szng0xg,10769,"hazy, blueish tint throws me off."
8r6zghmipd,10770,"i dont like the colors, but the picture and idea are cool."
jscbuole24,10771,this picture is awesome. very good mood and feeling.
2wrmhyn0qd,10772,great reflections! nice color and contrasts
dobn6e3j49,10773,clever.a nice result.perhaps the colour could have done with some correction as there is a yellow tinge here
mhxajn3n0x,10774,i see a ghost. something about this picture makes me think. i like it.
jyd33c475i,10775,ooh. . . nice colors to add a little drama and elegance to the photo. i like it alot.
9jrv3gj817,10776,"i really like this one, especially the softness and colortones."
afp695fzev,10777,"really neat. a bit orange for me, but otherwise awesome."
zr0y224hc9,10778,the adjectives earthy and mysterious both come to mind. at any rate it graps me.
el7j5qp3f5,10779,love the creativity and the warm black and white looks great!
698quwi4o2,10780,great setup and moust wonderful colors.
b0a79l47cx,10781,"very well done, looks like cousin it, like the sepia finnish."
ezfc66z1p5,10782,brag! only thing i see wrong is they should be white lenses.
xn0r790gvb,10783,i really like the bw convert. good job!
xn0r790gvb,10784,hmm wouldve liked it better had you mirrored the image so the words came out properly. but nice contrast
0y2v4mntfr,10785,"youre not allowed to have deliberate noise. which is oxymoronic in that it isnt noise if it belongs. but thats for pictures and not for digital ah, never mind. ill give it ten because nobody else will."
0y2v4mntfr,10786,why so much grain dude?
2pd0fu02oo,10787,"interesting dimensions. im not sure if the pink blur along the bottom was intentional or not, but its offputting."
7wl4g9jy0t,10788,very anthopomorphic! good color scheme as well.
8gbnwn617y,10789,the shadow was done on purpose i suppose. there is a seductive appeal to it.
n9tqke684j,10790,"classic collection of cameras, good sharp imge."
otzusstidd,10791,really like the image minus the camers shadow.
o7pyg7w150,10792,nice play with light and reflections but bit grainy aswell.
1czv8cb4iu,10793,in light of fresh info
shkx07ztjv,10794,the softness of towels work real nice just the one at bottom bit overexposed.
3q77m7r7qw,10795,like the colors and wrinkles. plus the trinity.
6ager38uhs,10796,"noisy picture, and blown out highlights. but i love the idea p"
977m3cdztl,10797,"dawg gone, this is cute. never would have seen the black fellow except that his tails sticking out lol."
1wqm8cby8y,10798,fantastic. great imagination and the color is wonderful.
1wqm8cby8y,10799,the lips look different enough.the teeth are a distraction. good thought tho.
1wqm8cby8y,10800,"i like this color and the contrast between the red and white, and the real lips blend in with the other lips. i also like how you included the rules of thirds."
1wqm8cby8y,10801,great idea! a little overexposed but cool
tg5u3rc2n1,10802,too much digital editing and severe color lines. reducing the contrast of an image doesnt make it better.
ifr88uzelj,10803,"wow, fantastic. it took me some time to see the whole thing, it really blends in. nice color"
th6vywks55,10804,is this camoflaged via motion blur? interesting idea.
girrnsgh8d,10805,"he is camouflaged alright. but the photo is too blurry, and messy."
o72k32wmg3,10806,"great example of a giraffes camouflage, however the flash effects really weaken the over all quality of the image."
nztlv68ccd,10807,"a trampers uniform, yes, but i cant tell about the camouflgae becaue of the bw"
64wccux22o,10808,"always thought of gators in terms of hiding or lurking, but green on green works."
qne1s63e4p,10809,"creepy. my friend is really afraid of ski masks. haha, i should show this to her. nice job! a little grainy, but good!"
bax9eojmdp,10810,cool capture but watch your flash. the light on the leaves is unappealing.
pdwitjmsd3,10811,this would have been very nice if it were a bit more sharper and the levels bumped so the black stands out greater.
tr4q1yfq4o,10812,"wow, talk about blending in! nicely done!"
x7jzpmp1du,10813,this iis such a cool image my pick for the blue
8le8tr44m8,10814,wow.what a macro. too bad it is in shadow though.
17857913am,10815,looks like damn cobra to me! hehe. are emerald snakes poisonous?
lgv9x8kefv,10816,hee hee i love this with the dappled light. beautifully done.
6s0w8vu9nr,10817,great photo! ccould use a levels adj and a bit more contrast.
rqdqzaj8qe,10818,clever idea and well done. the digital grain works and so does the tone.
avt4fcjc7r,10819,a pleasant image with great color play.
zszp2qt4o7,10820,"just about perfect, love the slight blur on the dc can blends in nicely"
1xyftqzcb5,10821,very industry falls into the hands of nature. i like how you have the green and brown of nature slowly overwhelming the green and brown that came from mans devices.
n5ir9ac4hi,10822,"excellent. nice capture. i might have tried darkening, just to see the different effects and blending."
ahc9jngn0h,10823,imo i am not a professional by any means. i personally wish there wasnt so much green in the photo. i am not really sure what geocaching is either.
ahc9jngn0h,10824,hee hee funny. i think id adjust curves to really give the green some punch. cute idea though.
roeto4isjz,10825,some of the picture is fuzzy! but its still a nice picture! good job!
0mq310ch0l,10826,looks like almost d picture. no idea how you got such bright and soft colors in one picture.
9p0i1ey0hf,10827,"nice macro. the colors are a little offputting, but hey, its nature, and theyre nice and vivid."
9p0i1ey0hf,10828,"technically an almost flawless photo. aesthetically, not the greatest, but certainly not bad."
zt5dw9hir0,10829,"this is a great picture, but i wish it was in a setting that accentuated the frogs coloration."
k0jjpdphv2,10830,"lol, the things we do to our pets. he does blend in well."
fmbx80wo53,10831,"very nice, detailed picture. impressive! me gusta!"
6u5vj6j9xa,10832,i see him.i know this is camouflage but i wish he was a little sharper.
7n9repcv6a,10833,very nice. the antlers almost blend in with the trees. i really like the brownorange against the green of the trees.
5qpd7ifyl3,10834,"very nice soft, subtle photo. nice placement in the photo."
uthcq68ctq,10835,wow! great detail on the whitetail!
cgy6q8p37b,10836,"im sure you could have done somehting really great. with a sharper, better exposed, better framed picture."
dthpnepnyr,10837,"cute, she blends in well, but the photo is too grainy for my likes."
3lusb50wqh,10838,this reminds me of the unknown comic on the gong show!
62gg1ec7j8,10839,"funny that she chooses exactly her colour no, wait. did you put her there?"
x9jqvsdwjb,10840,good interpretation.excellent detail and clarity.
yyxsrkdgtq,10841,"wow! good job! the insects camouflage is very good. some of the twigs or branches are a bit blurry, but its still a good picture. good job!"
u9n8wx7v6m,10842,the red and black colours are so rich. nice.

47fr482f4v,10882,"if you were going for huge amounts of grain, you got it. this seems puzzling to me. the hard edges are fairly clear, but the grain is heavy handed. did you apply bespeckle to this? i am sorry, but the best i can go is . swash"
47fr482f4v,10883,"what are the lines running thru this photo? did you add a texture you shouldnt have, or is it distortion from something?"

kur2gloa7x,10915,i have no idea why this specific hue was chosen but it ruined your photo.
kur2gloa7x,10916,i like the strange hue choice
kur2gloa7x,10917,special effect? too much loss of detail can you see the earlobe? swash
kur2gloa7x,10918,pink! brilliant! reminiscent of andy worhol. i love it
kur2gloa7x,10919,"im afraid im not too impressed with this one. i just dont get the whole pink effect, or what its trying to convey."
kur2gloa7x,10920,sorry the color is a bit too much for me.spiller
kur2gloa7x,10921,whats with the colour? was it purposeful?
kur2gloa7x,10922,the hue doesnt appeal to me.

uu5z9tbcru,10939,"an interesting capture with a somewhat candid feel. too dark below, too light in the highlights but it has an appeal i cant quite identify. i may return again to this one. for now bumping from to ."

qt1bb61zp5,10943,great colors. a beautiful photo a ten!
0qkiq6k659,10944,"desaturation doesnt work here at all, in my opinion."
bwx9pzwqdz,10945,nice candid action. bit contrasty
hfl9gx3upp,10946,love the miserry and graininess that you have captured here
hfl9gx3upp,10947,"im sure im not the first person to say this, but the grain is just not workin for me"
9f7c7apdb4,10948,a suggestion may be to lessen the saturation and contrast on the feathers.
ocetdve4z1,10949,would maybe be better a little darker with a little more contrast i think.
8i004kkmkm,10950,"just a bit tto dark, imo."
1btdemj0km,10951,"the desat really doesnt work here, imo"
1btdemj0km,10952,imho this is a good example of selective desat that doesnt really have a purpose. a totaly bw treatment once again mho would probably work better.
5l4pn36zi9,10953,love the colors! i also like his eyes.they are very expressive and say alot about the picture.
3q9ojsyauu,10954,"cool, indeed! great colors and you show just enough for the viewer to know what and where."
sl7ufn1pwa,10955,beautiful.this photograph is smooth as silk.rich colors and tones. i love it.
p3no1t4jix,10956,i like this a lot. it has a very dreamlike atmosphere. well done.
bokad0ahhd,10957,nice image. with the tones you have it might have looked better in bw or another type of duotone.
bokad0ahhd,10958,awesome i love the mood. the use of color adds that extra punch!
h25sb54aa8,10959,"i think this is great. my only nit is that on my calibrated monitor, it has a slight blue tint. not penalizing you though."
lvmziwzzom,10960,cool old dude. he looks like hes seen some life. personally id have preferred the sepia tone be a bit less green but i still like this very much.
ihloxdwfq6,10961,great contrast of colors a ten!
ihloxdwfq6,10962,this is like a bingo! picture. selective desaturation works here because its naturalfeeling.
kl4qbz9cpl,10963,a pretty luscious image. im not wild about the selective desaturation. maybe if the red were less agressive it would work better for me.
p5hitv6yqs,10964,very good light and contrast. cool candid!
2bph4m3x30,10965,nice work! wonderful use of bw. well done!
w56h1zhooq,10966,allaround excellent quality! a beautiful photo a ten!
e47hv9ui3x,10967,"great, fun, yet touching. bw suits it very well."
e47hv9ui3x,10968,that bums shoes looks awefully shiney.nice capture. very interesting dive hes doing! good choice on making this black and white. think it would have lost a lot in color.
mbpqu5ajhi,10969,the use of bw was perfect for this photo!
mbpqu5ajhi,10970,very nice. interesting and good choice for bw
xrrpa5utrn,10971,its funny to see such real kids subjected to such fake postprocessing.
xrrpa5utrn,10972,selective desaturation just doesnt work for me in this case. nice candid though!
tu0p09mi2t,10973,lovely natural light and good pastel colours.
q0djgtmubn,10974,"the processing, particularly the halos from sharpening, are a problem here, and the image simply isnt spectacular enough to overcome that."
z7o2itilop,10975,nice capture and use of motion blur.
4be7yvelub,10976,"this is ok, but just ok for me. the techs are ok. the candid is ok. it really doesnt meet my expectations of a candid though. i gave it a . i like to see something with a bit more interest and a bit more obscure."
xw7htbal2q,10977,i really like how she is grainy and the cars behind her are clear. kind of says something about her situation huh?
xw7htbal2q,10978,interesting. how you got the coloring and the switch from grainy to sharp in basic is something id love to know.
kccmdbco1e,10979,colors are kind of funky.
qvk7wbqczq,10980,pity about the white balance. nice candid.
pm6vmsfd3y,10981,nice smiles. id play with the midtones to maybe bringt out the contrast. makes you want to know what they are looking at!
5d4sc5may3,10982,"its an okay pic, but way too many hot spots."
ph19ipfrtt,10983,"and where was this taken? it has a lot of blue in it, even in the backgroundits cool."
b4on8rzyu1,10984,"oh wow. thats interesting. i think black and white might have had more of a journalistic feel, but thats just me."
yj5hsff277,10985,the color and grain is the first thing i notice.
yj5hsff277,10986,to much noise and dark shadows
j7cxzropv3,10987,this did well.glad to see but should have done better. great mood.
j6rfsfknbp,10988,this is really! funny! this is black male. lol for you
j6rfsfknbp,10989,rofl that is hilarious. the colors are a tad washed out. what about doing it in black and white?
v4hq00yeoy,10990,"cute children, but it doesnt scream candid to me. seems a bit ordinary and expected. nice tones and nice soft feel."
ei8ppkcgsv,10991,cool picture! nice blend of colors. i want to know what theyre all looking at!
aw61in29gj,10992,very goed quality shot.nice expresion capture.
owus2js6wq,10993,very odd image. at first i didnt notice that was a graphic behind him.
xl4i3xyxx9,10994,"today, even a beginner can take professional quality pictures, with correct exposures, meterings, etc. however, this is not totally true."
w9snstxz5h,10995,i really like this photo. its got a lot of detail to look at. well done! hope this one does well!
ash4gkc47h,10996,the sepia tonings work . but be careful not to overuse them.
rq29dd8acz,10997,"ok, well, i really dont like the coloring, although i understand your usage of it in this particular photo. i dont really see a candid here though. i like to see something a bit more unexpected in a candid, and to me this is just a bit ordinary."
c2pbk06nbb,10998,hes soo cute but a little blurry.
579c9gsflb,10999,"not sure what tamtam is, but i like the mood of this picture."
8534fjpjhf,11000,theres really bad jpeg artifacting in the dark areas of the image
q5hrw9x749,11001,on first look i thought it was a little washed out . on second was fine . i like natural light for taking pics . which is lovely.
yo4116uive,11002,anyhow couldnt let it pass off the front page with out telling you just how truly classic and great this image is. the only way i can really put it is
yo4116uive,11003,has a definate mood to this one.
yo4116uive,11004,i love black and white photos and this is beautiful! so clear and natural.
yo4116uive,11005,real nice bw.good contrast.
tjdt0bgpj7,11006,"excellent work, looks like something out of a movie. wondeful black and white."
vv0r4hebmo,11007,i love the muted colors and the shapes nice job
vv0r4hebmo,11008,real beautiful scenario.nice light and colors.
fttyb1pjc8,11009,"if only you had waited for her to take a drag off that ciggie, or to exhale. anything that would have brought life into the image. also, its a bit overexposed, wouldnt you say?"
tcicrt0e4y,11010,maybe the whole picture was just a bit dark?
9j5wr9wt05,11011,"not much of a mood to this picture, and seems a bit too staged"
5me7lgxbaq,11012,tragic but waay blurry. good idea though.
obo8kbthg7,11013,ok . black and white works . not stunning.
sfom90d8ha,11014,"this is a nice candid,there is a slight blur"
k1edxtyarh,11015,great use of sepia! wonderful texture absolutely beautiful!
591lmx2scz,11016,"oh, they must love you! lol.if only they were drooling. ok, well, anyway, i like the tones in bw conversion. its a good candid, but also one easily obtainable to me. not that hard when you know they wont see you coming. its a for me."
eigxtgnygx,11017,i like the soft hazy touch! great photo
n8ri9vv3x4,11018,real good quality bw.
7kg0wftr0e,11019,good natural colours . and a sharp picture.
bki8ddxuim,11020,"this would have been better presented in a bw format, but over all its a great image."
n43eo4j9w6,11021,good. but wonder it wud make a better pic if u toned down the colours a bit
9pye27mpgp,11022,"just a bit too obscure for me as to the tones. too light. its an ok candid, but not really unexpected or out of the ordinary for me."
zydw4w4am1,11023,an amazing capture youve got here. real world vs surreal world. the media freaks me out! the ideas of reality are so warped. excellent contrast of two worlds. very nice work!
zydw4w4am1,11024,"wow look at the many examples of contrast young and old, bright and dark, happy and sad, real and surreal! im impressed."
gmtca2mo6x,11025,white balance a bit off. imo the colour version wouldve been much better.
pr03qmi8x0,11026,"not a bad picture, but i would have liked a little color to contrast with the black hes wearing."
ci8822f9su,11027,then get a job dude! nice bw
i3gmtaznxt,11028,the colors are a bit flat on this and monochromatic even though it is in color. every thing seems to be of equal tones. im thinking maybe convert to bw and boost the contrast some?
b249melslp,11029,nice capture of the vibrant colors
b9bvgi5agf,11030,"candid, but not too interesting. nice tones for a bw though i wish the two shirts didnt blend together so much."
detqfxxv1l,11031,this looks like it is either over processed or could use neatimage. there is severe color distortion in the green bars that could easily be corrected
detqfxxv1l,11032,"meets the criteria for a candid, but is lacking in technicals. the artifacts i see are probably the result of bringing out detail in the shadows."
detqfxxv1l,11033,"nice candid capture! not sure whats going on with the colours. im seeing odd bandingnoise, especially the blues and greens."
zyn6tna871,11034,i really like the bright colors in this one and the nice contrast between the blue and the red.
zyn6tna871,11035,nice and saturated maybe has more of a personal appeal than a public one?
oylcxvboga,11036,"neat. . ive got to reward this sort of bold experimentation more, especially when it succeeds. bump to"
oylcxvboga,11037,"took me a minute to figure out how this was done. i think using black and white tied it together well, and better gives the effect of two separate pictures."
ytukbp72io,11038,"maybe not the most obvious or typical representation of candid, but a photo with a whole lot of atmosphere."
ytukbp72io,11039,"i love the darkness, i think it adds to the dreary rainy day."
snqrck651g,11040,beautiful light and tone of red.
fqjtumgom8,11041,a little noisy but what a character.
x2w5xwohjw,11042,"very good image, possibly could have been given a touch more pop through contrast adjustment"
w71fyhckc8,11043,wish the highlights were toned down a bit . his blown shoulders hurt this one .
dkc1knvrhw,11044,good choice of selective desat.
2q5608pmv4,11045,nice light but a tad soft and a tad boring.
l7550trqcp,11046,i like the rich blacks and the contrast a lot. very nice candid.
l7550trqcp,11047,the tones are a little dark.too much lost detail.
xvlbq084us,11048,great slice of life shote. the bw works very well here it really emphasizes the patterns on their shirts and what not.
xvlbq084us,11049,nice capture i like this a lot just the pp seems to let it down there are no real blacks or whites it all look s a little grey.
13rhp9gkax,11050,love the black and white tones and textures. great contrast.
13rhp9gkax,11051,nice capture great sharpness and detail love the reflections in the glasses.
d6jovhnrpr,11052,this is quite flat. it could probably be improved by boosting the levels and some curves adjustments.
3zhtjp4tfm,11053,nice capture like the colour and the chairs. nice.
ui1b6eyh76,11054,i think a candid needs to be of a person. i love black labs.
9r4c2xa1e9,11055,wow. this is one of the most stunning black and white conversions i have ever seen
9r4c2xa1e9,11056,nice capture like the tones and sharpness maybe just a bit too much of the map showing as it leaves a lot of nothing above it.
ycy25d6vy8,11057,nice sharpness but we cant tell hes ridin and its a tad boring. great tones though.
lkvbydbaio,11058,"i like the coloring, but it seems a bit soft in some places. noise reduction, maybe?"
lkvbydbaio,11059,quality! lovely candid and the duotone works well
mrxdw6zoxe,11060,good choice of selective colour but watch your editing.the edges are too obvious.
yvf22pbmou,11061,nice capture just looks a tad too warm and a little unsharp.
nuna6eq262,11062,"i like the blur and crazy angles here, its refreshing."
ke41std4nj,11063,nice but too much smoothing of the details.
58j86n0flr,11064,the photoshop blurring kind of ruins this one for me.
n504bqkymk,11065,a little bit blur for me. nice study though.
vledkexjwl,11066,nice work but watch your editing.the edge of the subjects is obvious.
qz95mmq7yg,11067,aww. green balance is interesting but it works.
vmblvak7ks,11068,"such a lovely photograph, beautiful bw conversion and the feeling of admiration of the youngest for the older person is almost tangiable pretty remarkable considering you cant see their faces"
vmblvak7ks,11069,nice capture nice feel to this wish it had a little more in the way of contrast to give it some punch.
zkheo27klg,11070,way too much hue saturation in the processing.
10fjv63f12,11071,"very nice, extremely clear photo, with nice colors and contrast."
8mhvfldt61,11072,what a great capture! my brother went to cornell and met his wife there. its a great path to choose this is a very nice capture and suites bw well.
suum2xf1zl,11073,more contrast would help. this fellow has been around the track a few times and it shows. good capture.
xa0nusc32p,11074,very well executed and a lovely bw conversion. strange image but nevertheless very appealing visually
kkb607iccu,11075,hey grats on the blue! wonderful capture and conversion
kkb607iccu,11076,a good fit for bw. the intensity on these girls faces captures the thrill of the waterride.
uslulo2lns,11077,kind of blah. not sure if it needs a little contrast or work with brihtness. just kind of grey
bq8v7gl8zu,11078,"wonderful image, the bw is a great choice."
bq8v7gl8zu,11079,"nice bw photo, nice tones."
d6jmrrnx6h,11080,"cute. nice sharp image, nice colours."
vjbgkk8x42,11081,"great capture, wonderful light and color"
vjbgkk8x42,11082,"great image, very nice texture and color."
iwqh7bk1pu,11083,beautiful soft but thoughtful portrait.
y837nj624p,11084,"ohh i know this feeling so well, beautiful capture and i love the bw conversion"
5p457zvavk,11085,just got a warm and fuzzy feeling the instant i saw this one of unconditional sibling love
5p457zvavk,11086,nice but way too much neat image.
pudvokj6rv,11087,"great bright colors, makes a nice candid."
bat6ebukjx,11088,nice capture maybe a tad too contrasty wish he was walking towards us.
1whhd0kdrn,11089,nice capture nice and sweet and sharp. like the bricks.
4pkhsghhxm,11090,"great natural light, very nice tones in the conversion."
1gbds8wwgt,11091,nice capture needs some contrast though as those blacks are weak.
zhfllhi41s,11092,thats candid. desat works well here.
9snl9dhvqk,11093,"beautiful colors, and use of surroundings. innocence captured!"
7v8n5eh7nc,11094,"the image is a bit too hotsaturated but its a good candid. however, while i like the idea of the motion of life passing her by, its a shame its not real blurring."
fjckt3iwa5,11095,good contrasts and tones on the bw.
fjckt3iwa5,11096,great blur motion! awesome bw study
sbhi0ofqvh,11097,does make you wonder with those smirks.nice light and tones in this photo.
oqb0cainji,11098,lovely photo and a beautiful macro. i agree with becky.a bit more saturation might work well.
oqb0cainji,11099,great macro. the detail in the wings is excellent.
9h2xa1hf9p,11100,"technically, the picture seems a bit flat, and the colors do, too, but it is so freaking funny, it has to be considered a good picture."
z1jcmv4rhc,11101,nice sepia colours. a bit dark. maybe its just me .
51f6clh5gy,11102,nice bw. great use of selective desaturation.
51f6clh5gy,11103,good choice of selective desat.
3cdvy0mwub,11104,nice blue but a tad boring.
tpt8rwy1jc,11105,nice and sharp. probably has more of a personal appeal than a public one.
wt514qrj10,11106,good candid.but too much dark tones for this to shine.
2cpg9noqqj,11107,nice fun pic wish there was a little more sharpness and his feet.
nck5lr5lbm,11108,nice colours but a tad boring and grainy.
qko53woljh,11109,nice capture nice and sharp and good tones.
5ew3xfk9jz,11110,"nice photo, soft on impact."
dj0kysxxf4,11111,bright sharp picture well done. psart
rj0fztazpn,11112,very cool candid capture the contrast and grain work well here
rj0fztazpn,11113,"a little too much added noise, in my opinion."
5z3xpl9ds3,11114,i really like this. bare flourescent lights and gray floors are ugly in a beautiful sort of way.
5z3xpl9ds3,11115,love the blue lights and the barren appearence. it works very well with your idea.
5z3xpl9ds3,11116,interesting image although does seem to suffer a little from noise and grain
5i2900f0oz,11117,nice capture.but the haloing and loss of detail and artifacting has really destroyed this image.
2mcydxux4o,11118,nice contrast maybe the exposure is a tad overdone.
hnwv1we6bh,11119,nice vivid colour in the late afternoon light.
lkb2hwmyfc,11120,the selective desat looks weird and offputting.
5j0tayeady,11121,nice capture could do with a little more punch with contrast as it all looks a bit too grey.
j4acmz3tqs,11122,nice capture like this a lot. wish there was a bit more punch to your black and white conversion though. no real blacks.
j4acmz3tqs,11123,"this really conveys the boredom, well done, good choice on the bw."
o0cp62mwwj,11124,excellent capture. nice bw processing.
az1f77rsx7,11125,nice lines but a tad unsharp.
hz2f9upu8r,11126,this is an absolutely gorgeous photograph! love the color tones.
hz2f9upu8r,11127,"nice capture wonderful light, sharpness and pp feels a tad too much like a portrait though to win me over in a candids comp."
h7k12ahyzw,11128,"for me thats for blue, but red is good too d"
h7k12ahyzw,11129,"great job, really nice tones and sharpness, so natural and candid and its nice to see an image do well where the person has not been plastisized! really nice!"
0d4dbh7su8,11130,ohh.nice bw study! all the way
0d4dbh7su8,11131,decent tones but the image is a little soft
ej0lcr7rnr,11132,"a good familystyle candid, i find myself wanting a little more contrast."
6b4zkqodnj,11133,very harsh light. not the best flash work ive seen.
5fs36v3ia0,11134,slurrp! nice bright colours.
jsoads5v6o,11135,i feel like im watching his own childhood returning in full daydream colors.
mx02xk44y0,11136,looks like theyre having fun. there is just a bit too much motion blur for me.
0rj3zipi70,11137,appearing to be very noisy on my monitor. i guess the problem with candids like this is that by their very nature you dont have time to adjust your settings
w3v5bsz6d3,11138,dont look like much conversin goin on. nice capture but your whites are a touch blown out. nice contrasty black and white.
w3v5bsz6d3,11139,lots to look at maybe let down a little with technical issues such as sharpness etc.
cueznmxko6,11140,. i wonder how this photo was taken without getting and blow out of the colour rather than the flatulant variety
cueznmxko6,11141,damn! thats one white beehindd!
x51uzku4r2,11142,great expressions but a lot of noise.
0gu2fv6018,11143,wonderful and soft image. good work.
5c8xrn5qqa,11144,there is a lot of noise on her face.i also think it is a little close
r46hmzze7u,11145,good candid.a little noisy.
orggxoa3ny,11146,love the stripes and the bw conversion.
1rgssvfc1v,11147,nice capture but the contrast is a bit extreme.
1lop1hs1ks,11148,there is just a little too much contrast between the light and the shadows.
5xk68f2hls,11149,i personally dont care for the motion blur of the person.
aysynkndr2,11150,great pp. nice colors and contrast.
obzmt26l3t,11151,good capture and i like the contrast between the blacks and whites
0xcibq4mul,11152,nice sharp image and good bw tones
vounr549rn,11153,a little too dark at the bottom of the photo for my taste.
afk7mgc77d,11154,i like all the different brown tones and patterns. well done!
krx73il62v,11155,"cute and candid, not sure why but the image seems a little flat. good job though"
3vguh4458m,11156,"nice capture, too much grey.maybe a levels adjust for blacks to make the image pop more. possibly more contrast as well."
fpxh52qnzi,11157,nice capture of empotion but the graininess is not workign for me here.
m22uefze0z,11158,"i really dont know why i like this so much.did you have to go and break all the rules? too dark, to busy, blah blah blah."
m22uefze0z,11159,good attempt but way too dark and busy.
m22uefze0z,11160,"a little too dark, imho, but still an interesting capture"
4cm9f2pntp,11161,"blurry, dnmc. p"
4cm9f2pntp,11162,"eiww. sorry, the blur is killing it for me."
4cm9f2pntp,11163,very clever use of the blur filter.
4cm9f2pntp,11164,"nice use of a photoshop filter or effect, or whatever."
spy0jrai5c,11165,a very beautiful capture and lovely soft green in the backgroundgreat
uzbk62ci2t,11166,i think your a tad bit underexposed here. you lost a lot of dark detail.
uzbk62ci2t,11167,looks very flat and probably has more of a personal appeal than public
uzbk62ci2t,11168,"poor lad, nice picture but looking dark on my monitor."
fhklwfz0a8,11169,a little blown in the light areas.
icvnm3larg,11170,wierd choice for selective desat. sorry but i really dont like it. i would give you a if it were all black and white. as it is now.
icvnm3larg,11171,backgrounds not colorful enough for this effect to work.
icvnm3larg,11172,"the desaturation makes for an interesting effect, but i think it would be better if it had definite blacks instead of just various shades of gray"
icvnm3larg,11173,"too much processing.the black and white and red light makes for an odd photo, and clashes, and is not elegant or pleasing. if the message was to correlate a red sign its loaded meaning with his state i can see where that is going, but otherwise."
icvnm3larg,11174,like this image a lot more on second viewing than i did on first. the bw works well as the greyness really helps get across the feeling of exhaustion. nice desat job too
icvnm3larg,11175,"very nice pic, just dont see why you use selective desat, it doesnt add anything to the image, imo."
r78e1eko3g,11176,"a bit dull, bw wise."
6zi8n53lnc,11177,looks a little soft and i am not too sure about the colour it is candid but a tad boring.
gnv779qodn,11178,like the selective desat processing you did on this and its a cute capture.
gnv779qodn,11179,nice choice on th selective desat. really makes this stand out.
ldr4jitd3q,11180,nice sepia look. almost feels pink though.
ldr4jitd3q,11181,"nice capture, but i dont particularly care for the pink tone."
6ha0ex9cvv,11182,"im sorry i dont get whats going on here, technically the image is a bit blurry"
aoitxu3jm2,11183,"nice bw tones, but too many distractions."
to1knvkphk,11184,great candid curiuos as to why you decided to make this bw?
to1knvkphk,11185,very very cool capture and wonderful bw! fantastic candid
38ownooyiz,11186,very nice bw. classy looking
akn3g4djn1,11187,nice.but the glow is a little too obvious in some places. it has caused some sever detail loss.
84k23qye1m,11188,nice saturated colours nice capture wish we could see what he was looking at!
qfb44owptl,11189,at first i wasnt too keen on the grain but then it grows and fits well with the character.
qfb44owptl,11190,a tad boring and let down badly on the technicals. too grainy and has a green cast to it.
ztbfxwfguj,11191,nice capture like this a lot just needs some much needed contrast and punch in the black and whites.
bo7821nl0m,11192,"poor image quality, blurry, noisy, and datestamped."
2m1dyy3mk8,11193,and youre supposed to be young and green and ammacher.
yi40if3aoi,11194,something classic here my tip for the blue.
u7nrgwon4z,11195,"wow, very nice lights and tone."
pfrfik5yd7,11196,"diferent from the other photos but im not sure how much i like it, maybe the unique idea, yes, but i still can see anywhere a candit"
svoy1vrj8f,11197,wish it were a little sharper and had some pop via curvescontrast
mb3l1107i2,11198,the light humor in your description makes it a very interesting read
zypu18aehb,11199,"i would like to see this picture without a tint, i.e. to see peoples clothes white as it is"
olk8evz8gk,11200,"this photo is very nice, the colors, the feel is good. even the clutter and business of the photo works good. good job."
wsnt9ffpoj,11201,"real colourful, clash or not. love it"
npci1f0f0o,11202,my daughter likes the way it looks like an old time photo but its in color
4ql0bwikkk,11203,great bw work with difficult light. bet none of them make over k. .
hqtd3oq73n,11204,go flames go ! wheres a pic of the red mile hotties ?
d4vbli8pb6,11205,"great job, julianne! the texture and crispness of this black and white photo makes it so striking!"
c3op54c3lr,11206,"he looks confident that he will win the game, i like that look, this photo is great i just wish he had the black pieces, the chessplay can be barely seen"
o08srq334c,11207,super tonality here one of few true candids
o08srq334c,11208,nice sepia tonings actually looks like an old photo. good effort
gf7khkd9e7,11209,completely love this great contrast and all the elements in the image are excellent.
fhpg1bkdjl,11210,just another promising candidate standing in the wrong line.
i2cgm3nxk2,11211,"this is just a beautiful picture, plus or minus nothing. the selective desat does no harm at all and the sepia is just great. firing off mad bursts and running sounds like a technique to me"
bc636owroi,11212,"eta colour distracts take it from me, i know everything. what?"
bbt67uj4ro,11213,the colors are so beautiful and she is quite adorable. great capture.
djkyimpw7h,11214,excellent candid. bw obviously works very well here.
u78dngzi83,11215,"hey! no peeking! very cute holiday candid. love the colors. but for the editing rules, i would clone out the wires. nice job!"
ilqg62dvjp,11216,not a bad poseexpression wish it were a bit sharper and clearer though.
8eq0fieklf,11217,the quality of the image overcomes the minor spelling issue.
s541ayzn8m,11218,i love how hes so deep in thought and totally unaware you are taking his photo. great line and tones here.
2fz1jzbnct,11219,"white balance seems off yellowish, but a very cute candid!"
8zo8361jqi,11220,"oh i like this capture, reason is its soft capture. loved it, gud work !"
qikqrxm62k,11221,way overporcessed. the muddy textures obliterate any detail in the image.
mt8spdyzyt,11222,the grainy resolution adds a nice touch to this photo. nice job.
j0n37ud9e7,11223,good macro managment! interesting way to capture the real colors.
fjmuvcmfmt,11224,"soft, sexy, serene and special."
ei29rth9or,11225,candles light is too bright and spent matches should have been discarded.
371pe648dp,11226,great color diggin the slinky effect
371pe648dp,11227,"beautiful lights, beautiful graphics and a pleasant play of light"
1145pz9nrf,11228,"it is quite old this father christmas, the age made him lose the clearness of the image."
snhm7mju2a,11229,this one express a cosy feeling. some light from above could have made it better imo.
1n5n23sx9q,11230,"the model looks a little bored. i think a better pose would help, too. the vignetting around the edge of the image does not help, either."
nnxwntqfqh,11231,"wow. cant decide if the blur is intentional or not, but this is cool in some way that i cant explain."
ont765w8u6,11232,i really like the feel of this. has a classy mood. well done
aqzcryefrv,11233,looks to be a little over smoothed with neat image or a like app.
aqzcryefrv,11234,really bright. kinda get lost in the picture in what im looking for.
j69a4ngmvu,11235,very well composed photo. i love the soft quality to it. excellent!
j69a4ngmvu,11236,"love her look and the colors, but its a little too grainy. other than that, its great! ."
fz97hwnfhg,11237,wow! nice combinations of colors balance of light.
ytgsp8yndf,11238,kinda bright. love the christmas feal.
hw5wrqpkx4,11239,"soft light, sexy figure and th dark dackground enhanses the image"
4t9ljbd09v,11240,"i really like this, it has such warmth with a beautiful rustic look"
f9ecm1u6h8,11241,"soft clean image, and a good photo as well."
f9ecm1u6h8,11242,an exceptional neat presentation.
hg3moaigt8,11243,amazing use of light and shapes.beautiful
jjr7tvpacs,11244,i like the candles but not sure of shortness of them and the straight line.
ggrx1tg6rg,11245,i like this image with th soft light reflecting on the person
xpcbe72ntv,11246,this is nice and graphic.the red white and black. u know your color sceams alright.
c0ntv0vyyb,11247,slightly hazy for some reason.
c0ntv0vyyb,11248,"nice setting, could be sharper. p.s. where are the candles?"
125nwt56bt,11249,there were so many holiday pics and just plain crappy pictures. this is truly a great idea. and bw made it perfect. excellent job.
co69jjmisl,11250,"very romantic feel, and i actually like the soft touch to it. could be a little brighter."
em9ajbhqgm,11251,"oo, spooky. interesting texture."
5j9x6s9n0g,11252,"orangish, interesting patterns and textures."
5j9x6s9n0g,11253,glarey. white balance needs less orange.
5j9x6s9n0g,11254,"lovely, i can see the texture on the sweets, shame the light is is adding shine to the tops"
9w0yyfv602,11255,nice exposure and interesting lines in your chocolates.
398hxntfyw,11256,"witty use of color, excellant photo!"
iduxgqq3lq,11257,the red skittles! clever. extra points for making it interactive.
iduxgqq3lq,11258,"nice bright colors, and i see the skittle!"
iduxgqq3lq,11259,nice pic. im guessing the extra orange is the party crasher?
iduxgqq3lq,11260,"wow, this is very clean and sharp. nice job! oh, and i found that little rascal."
ryvzom88du,11261,is this a real photo? photo of a printpainting? it just looks fake. is it just extremely oversharpened?
ryvzom88du,11262,nice job with the mosaic.maybe a teeny bit oversharp for my taste.
ryvzom88du,11263,"this had to take a bit of time to arrange. a for effort. i couldnt personally tell what filtersenhancements were used, but it does have a waxy appearance different effect did you use extra sharpening? nicely composed as well. super job!"
ryvzom88du,11264,"tops for your idea, patience, and lovely colors."
ryvzom88du,11265,"jeez, that musta taken a while. colors look weird. very noisy too."
5j8v7f1d9r,11266,an odd assortment of textures. needs white balance adjusted and more contrast.
5j8v7f1d9r,11267,"clashes a bit, doesnt it. not color, but subjects. if only this were good for you you would have a best seller."
5j8v7f1d9r,11268,ill bet kids love to eat at your house.your a fun cook! pretty colors. nice.
5j8v7f1d9r,11269,i think this photo would show a lot more colors if it were a little less exposed. nice idea just in time for easter. pretty good pic all around tho.
cgab7a6obk,11270,"these look like nematodes. mm. the backlighting is fun here, but it does make them look like microscopic creatures for some reason."
89sir7th13,11271,good presentation.clear and sharp.
phar5xllmm,11272,i love his grey beard. what a cutie.
7a50awfha8,11273,"cute, cute basket.background is a bit too busy with all thats going on here. nice try, love the colors."
p9ugf99t8l,11274,excellent! great use of shadow and colour!
96couxc3d4,11275,"umm, i love that stuff. theres a little bit of a yellow tint to it. use levelscurves to get a slightly more natual look."
qpxl97ccnp,11276,"not sure what you were trying to do here. i think if you kept it a little simpler, with fewer colors you could have pulled it off. i like you thought process, it just didnt quite work."
qpxl97ccnp,11277,strange color scheme going on! i like it would have preferred it last week because the first thing in my mind is color! great job.
76rhcsmtnp,11278,this photo has great texture. a really good macro. well done
mvvx98jnai,11279,"too dark. im not too keen on the idea, but the pic definitely needs a little more light to bring out the colors in the berries and other fruits effectively. well laid out though."
bu15i25i44,11280,did you tell him that the bribe was the picture. i like the subtle gray tones playing off the color.
252q9aq7vt,11281,excellent rendition of texture.
ehtgxcfnli,11282,very cool macro and a great idea. highlight a little hot on the peppermint but awesome never the less.
mvc4cslt4u,11283,well composed. you might try adjusting for the lighing source so the color balance does not rob your subjects of their bright colors.
97o4ub485c,11284,white balance is off its yellowish. use levelscurves to fix.
2pv0mqzv04,11285,good job but the colors seem washed out to me. brighter maybe would have been better imho
a7kzvl0awl,11286,"nice bright colors, just a little blown out on some places."
a7kzvl0awl,11287,"fantastic colors. light is a little harsh, but this looks nice.looks good too!"
qmljgnuy8b,11288,excellen color contrasts. an effective picture.
lxritjaeyg,11289,really nice work! so much impact from so few colors!
lxritjaeyg,11290,great idea and execution. just a bit more contrast in the shadows and i feel this would have been the best! but still a solid ! good work!
lxritjaeyg,11291,great effort. needs a lot more contrast tho
lxritjaeyg,11292,"i love the white on white, but it does seem to need something to give it a little more pop. maybe a touch more contrast?"
lxritjaeyg,11293,"very subtle,well composed photo. your choice of an all white format works well here."
lxritjaeyg,11294,very nice idea using white on white. very cool and refreashing.
kkju9d6vvs,11295,nice bright colors. had to work really fast huh?
wafkliriap,11296,some are trying to escape. great humor! very sharp and colorful.
wafkliriap,11297,interesting but i think there are some aberrations around most of the snakes which detracts from its quality. nice idea.
t27r50a7qq,11298,"i love mms, and the colors here just pop!"
dcl4omg5qi,11299,i downloaded the image and did little bit adjustment with sharpening and now it looks little better. you could send me pm to see what changes i made. i could send you the modified version.
9l0p39a0v9,11300,are those sour skittles? i want some! mm. i feel like the contrast is a bit off but otherwise this is neat. good sharpness and detail.
n1lkgi28l7,11301,"i like the texture of your image, but for the life of me cant make out what it is. lol."
ezhc5f6n6p,11302,"mm sweet photo, a touch dark maby but i think it looks pretty good"
vh4bnxrq0t,11303,superb desat and a very cool portrait
dlecb12uf9,11304,peeps! my kids love these things but i must admit that we prefer the classic yellow ones pretty good macro on these guys you have captured their texture pretty well
7gaefuyjxp,11305,interesting desaturation. the weed in front of his shirtsleeve detracts.
r9iglt5vtr,11306,"nice idea, but the yellowish color doesnt work well. the stripes should be bright white."
r9iglt5vtr,11307,"very patriotic, but the colors seem just a little flat in the red and white."
r9iglt5vtr,11308,the only thing this needs is for the whites to be less yellowish. otherwise it is great!
n4q0qxfe5m,11309,good macro but imho the shadows are a tad dark. nice work anyway
n4q0qxfe5m,11310,good details in this macro i just think the image is ever so slightly underexposed
n4q0qxfe5m,11311,nice texture and color but thisis a little dark.
ql2itjzrq9,11312,"maaybe a not so crosseyed look would be better, lol. colors are fantastic."
ql2itjzrq9,11313,i do get the idea and the colorful display.
ejyp5234wc,11314,"love it. simple,effective and grea texture."
xoq96dny8d,11315,a little dark but a sweet idea
hjylt7715r,11316,"they seem to be happy worms, the way they swarm all over. nice bright colors"
hjylt7715r,11317,cool setup. its very bright though. a little blown out.
m2g78su8vo,11318,mitosis. very clear and colorful.
mjuhs74ff3,11319,"interesting processing, kinda spooky picture to me honestly but for something unique"
mjuhs74ff3,11320,the filter doesnt do anything for me at all in this pic.
fm2lkyrbii,11321,sweet idea! original and colorful.
x7o5v2x1ru,11322,"i like the pastels, nice change from all those bright colors ive seen so far."
50v1lbs4fb,11323,vey since setup. the bright spots are a lttle distraction.
7ktlfglxzm,11324,odd but i thought of the moonwalker video.
d43dg9z8k4,11325,good sharp image but there are several areas that dont quite work in my opinion.
nt6qrwawj1,11326,shame about the aberrations on the white stuff.
ip34pyimh2,11327,"beautifully done, great control of light, great clarity."
mjygtdrzgn,11328,wow! im so surprised that booboogoon thought the colors were dull? i think the colors are kickbutt vibrant and awesome. i love this one!
mjygtdrzgn,11329,nice clear and pretty vibrant colors.
cwxz3dzqbz,11330,"mm, lindt? i like the warm colors."
oak4xvgifm,11331,"great lightgin, color and good idea."
i2mckswfil,11332,"cool idea, well thought out. it looks a tad bit dark to me but still good."
l5v2hld095,11333,yummy! the flatware seems like it could have been shinny instead of dulling the image. i understand you might not want the distraction either.
2kw8tewr22,11334,colors and clarity are a little compromised.
01wwau1jr6,11335,"beautiful alicia, the bright colors are so fun!"
a3y3jmotm3,11336,purple was a good choice of color to compliment the facial tones. nice!
rq1n5ruqco,11337,beautiful bright and colorful arrangement
5m2zsv5ao8,11338,"i like the idea! however, the image is noisy. the lightning could be better also."
sfp6vu6hwh,11339,"a little brighter and a little more contrast would help this. i like the colors and arrangement, but it lacks zing."
mapysjjqvv,11340,"bright, colorful photo nice macro!"
mapysjjqvv,11341,good solid macro the details of the discs are very clear and the colors seem very true
65spj317q7,11342,"so cliche, but ever so nice! good color choice, except maybe the brown. flawlessly executed in my opinion."
65spj317q7,11343,"hey! thats neat! cant wait to hear how you did this, neat photo."
ofn96g0o20,11344,what a great photograph. i love how it shows two ways of life. the sad and desolate and the little tidbits of life that make everything worth it. i love the clarity and the colors used in this photo.
98x0xmws3l,11345,"i think you like reeses as for a photo, its a bit uninspired, orange on orange doesnt work all that well. i like it that you included the phoneremote, it gives it some character."
v60ros31wt,11346,"to me, this could have been to best of the lot. it looks like something went wrong somewhere along the line especially with the colors. as it stands, i think a conversion to bw would have helped? it was a great! idea for a photo."
v60ros31wt,11347,"love the idea and how you executed this. are there helium balloons in the boxes? not sure i personally care for the color treatment of this, though."
tvh0sys0n3,11348,"with a little less noise and a little more sharpnessfocusnonblur this would be so fantastic! its good as it is, but with less noise and such it would really stand out."
69u5zubs6s,11349,"what a silly, dark picture. and yet it brings a new world to life. i give you the posthumous red."
tbm9ettzig,11350,"a little otherworldly on the eyestongue saturation, a cute image nonetheless."
c8jqvew95v,11351,this should be popular.good stuff! i like the slight desaturation
2bkg5z8dg9,11352,like the idea. good comp. seems a bit oversharpened.
6w2wpe7zqo,11353,i really like that the yellow of labels is pretty much the same hue. it adds visual continuity.
j08me2zd1g,11354,your white balance appears to be off. a bit of a heavy yellow cast.
561dsz64xj,11355,"sweet, good detail, especially on whiskers whiskers! i like the soft colors."
cf6p04plgn,11356,"im not a smoker muyself, but i appreciate the sentiment expressed here. the shots not very good, to be honest, but i give you credit for a good idea."
xhmmd2xast,11357,"fun character, and nice colors"
fvwmeqmzgb,11358,"nicely controlled hdr. i hate overdone hdr, but this is tops."

kumhgsvdl0,11360,love the lightingshadows and the cutouts. great artistry.
hxjtshhi2n,11361,great picture. light is very accurate. vigneting is a bit heavy.

yxbfky8rag,11363,"color, saturation, and hue na, image is monochrome."
843icg1w93,11364,"good creativity, but the image is a little dark."
jitixsg9zr,11365,i have given this a mainly beause i like the colour and treatment and it evokes a sadness in me nicely done
rcdpewqd4g,11366,remarkable simulacrum. posthumous yellow for you.

nminr3n0sf,11372,"hopefully this one made it safely through the season. theyre still hunting through early dec. where i live. blah. nicely composed, good colors."
v763xm8bs8,11373,"i dont know why, but this one doesnt do it for me. i do like the colors, but somethings missing, i cant really figure out what that is."
rw2auwrkmg,11374,nice exposure and use of filter.
u4rg4erphq,11375,"what great colors and contrast, kinda glow effect, well done"
tfyhrl9910,11376,"could use a little more contrast i guess, but the idea is nice"
ov2p3t5foa,11377,hmm i guess im not in the christmas mood yet. santas either p
w7ykmtp9td,11378,they look very happy! nice contrast and b w
w7ykmtp9td,11379,"young love. i have a memory of it somewhere deep in my mind, nice choice for bw good tones and contrast"
lb4ml4vsr8,11380,great job catching time of day contrast is excellent breathtaking!
nd64u279pl,11381,not sure what you were goin for here. this looks like a photo of a glow in the dark poster.
99tlox5jmt,11382,such nice silky smooth waters. i love the serenity and tranquility this image conveys great colors too.
kolz36em89,11383,"actually, thats the navys blue angels team, in san francisco for fleet week celebrations."
ze65crg9id,11384,id have liked to see more contrast. black blacks and white whites. a little too gray.
d7sz9tc7wu,11385,good capture in difficult light
9sythjwejp,11386,"i can see the celebration but look at what wins, this isnt even average imo. its sharp but thats about it."
esu6j0oq21,11387,hooray !what is your celebration? that white men can jump?
f16445jocg,11388,natural and elegant. black and white works.
f16445jocg,11389,this is a quality bw image. the halfones are smooth and balanced. the image also stands as celebratory
f16445jocg,11390,this is an awesome black and white photo. great job. very candid.
ljl9i7bs0c,11391,"this looks a little grainny to me, and i think the colors could be a little sharper"

82ox7g3fga,11393,"i love fireworks.mm, and the colors. good job."
krmno41vpy,11394,"very funny, sharp, and nice red color.sorry to hear you need viagra"
0vc7e46tbv,11395,great action. love the sharp detail in the from and the colours.
u6tmz2uw8s,11396,looks a bit static. capturing the movement on a slight blur may have been more interesting.
jb4gn9e38c,11397,lots of noise and a little too busy imo.
qzli6fsn24,11398,very nice and festive colors here! love the extra effort you made to create this image!
me4er558oe,11399,"interesting image, but depends a little heavily on the postprocessing imho."
844iu7cc19,11400,"not really sure what im seeing here. as far as the colors go, its great and so is the offset comp of this image."
844iu7cc19,11401,is that a drain? are you sucking my life down the drain? very different but interesting image. very unique!
u0dda4x0f7,11402,this is a fresh colourful idea! nice work! o
ahehpg297a,11403,this is a really sweet photo. the use of black and white gives me a kind of loneliness feeling for the kids however in my opinion.
gtpporkase,11404,"hmm not sure what to say about this one. person looks a little too dark, but thats kinda what makes the photo interesting."
hwhqzw0twc,11405,theres a nice atmosphere in this photo. but the selective blur not sure if you did that is a little too obvious for me.
hwhqzw0twc,11406,"i like the look and feel here, escpecially in bw."
hwhqzw0twc,11407,"the blur looks really fake, but this is a piece of beauty,"
snh6kwasss,11408,what a terrific image of light and movement. withotu the caption though its hard to read celebraion into it.
2t282gfa68,11409,so cute! the white is a bit blown out but thats ok. the love between the two brothers is evident in this image
6d09cqjlgo,11410,"lots of noise, pity."
6d09cqjlgo,11411,way too much noise. a night time picture is hard to take.sorry.
sjv8j7d4tn,11412,very deep and a little oversharpened. comp is great as are the colors.
ae2estruuy,11413,"the clouds are great, and i like the darkness of the picture."
vba9nuucuu,11414,the colors are very vibrant but the whites are dingy making the photo off and not as cheerful as probably intended. however upon opening it i thought of the th of july!
15459141dm,11415,i like the different shades of grey in the picture.
kcfo5fxkkt,11416,"play with the levels a bit more to lighten it, but otherwise a good photo."
mwk2y7yfn3,11417,i love the colors in this image. very cute idea.
4s1ptzm6vq,11418,"this is dangerous and blurry, but good idea."
4s1ptzm6vq,11419,i like the blur to this image. adds to the feeling of rushed time.
08y79ulpvz,11420,blue and red! wooww
2oa97yv9np,11421,bebe is a huge distraction!
7tesnyfyz0,11422,this image is rather blurry you really cant tel whats in th picture
7tesnyfyz0,11423,great idea! im guilty as charged! i almost always have to call the wife from the store. i wish the image was a little sharper tho.
zjwphey60x,11424,the photo is a bit dark and it could use some sharpening. that antenna has seen better days.
24wuqugzat,11425,i like the unlikely setting you chose to display a cellphone. good choice of color tone.
86j9d8t37y,11426,wow i think that this is going a little over the edge here but i like the way you have captured the phones torture
86j9d8t37y,11427,"very innovative, great image quality"
2hchu1c2y2,11428,must not be tmobile if she has a signal! lol! nice use of duotone.
2hchu1c2y2,11429,i like the color of your photograph. in my opinion it helps to sell the photo.
2hchu1c2y2,11430,nice image i like thegrainy contrast
0jkf7avfqo,11431,love the originality and the picture is very welldone. love the black and white from me
eg2kfrf8aq,11432,"aw thats sad. very realistic though. nice job, i love the idea you had! and the colors are beautiful."
r9tojjc83c,11433,good potrait. and the contrast and bw works well.
r9tojjc83c,11434,i really like the contrast as well as the genuine feel to this image.
jqtk1sqpfg,11435,"lengthen the exposure to reduce flash noticebility. you can and should still use onboard flash, just make it less noticable to the viewer."
7ouph3qkhs,11436,you really did a good job of portraying the mood through this photograph!
cgehbgkpww,11437,i love the motion blur to the photograph. nice work!
ey7uv9yqvf,11438,i like the movement and feeling of rushing in this. nice cazpture and tones.
zngpz7qi1k,11439,a bit too much grain for my taste
zngpz7qi1k,11440,"very oversharpened, gives this a bit of a comical effect for a badnewsshot."
zngpz7qi1k,11441,this photo has a lot of contrast and detail i like it a lot nicely done
yp3x6cdowg,11442,"maybe its just me, but the white balance looks like it could have done with some work if thats an intentional colour cast, i apologise"
yuhbvvx3xa,11443,"to my jugdement, photographic integrity is maintained. my purpose was to enhance textures and contrasts already present in the original image. i didnt even use sharpen filters or masks of any kind."
yuhbvvx3xa,11444,god almighty.this is impressive!
ofhzj8eo1i,11445,"great idea and the sepia was a good choice,"
wimsezcbu7,11446,"black and white works well on this picture, but i think the photo might have worked better if she was at one of the standing tombstones."
guk59lybf6,11447,lost details from either flash or overexposure of whites.
m1p7p2e86l,11448,great pov. the vignetting effect creates an interesting mood.
yff71nhn28,11449,the content of this photo is not apealing to my personal tastes because this is a young childs gravesite however i like the contrast and quality of the photo. also it is more original than some of the others here.
yff71nhn28,11450,"interesting, extra touch. i love your idea. nice tones and light control."
jtyi84uhdg,11451,intriguing use of the tones and colors. almost has a touch of magic in it.
oq3iz1915l,11452,great photo i someshow would have liked to see green in this photo but it could be the wrong time of year. awesome job!
u1rtdfmp73,11453,real bright. adjust that and you have done an ok job.
la3rt7qo7r,11454,"very touching photo, excellent in black and white."
wwliaqdb5r,11455,"great light and textures, but the highlights are a touch too hot. it could have been great, but it is quite good."
hzs50ywn8f,11456,"to me this would have been better in pure bw , the bluish doesnt work"
iev32n5fzx,11457,"very nice, great slective coloring,"
6uin8akgws,11458,light and shadow play work well here.
6w8spzt0v2,11459,i love you tone and mood.magic!
0oigeq9ytz,11460,i like it nioce conversion to a slight sepia look.
fvznroxtmu,11461,"this is spooky, wonderful image, very good detail."
fvznroxtmu,11462,"beautiful, bw is definitely the way to capture this."
uzu0z3mzyl,11463,bleak and effectivewhat is that in colour far away.i kind of like it and at the same time find it a bit annoying as i am not sure of what i am looking atoverall well done.
mfqe89gf7m,11464,"its a little too dark, but i really like the glowing effect around the dark graves.kinda spooky"
zoq4jh6oym,11465,"i very much like the way you handled the tonaltiies in this, although a bit more shadow detail in the trees might? have helped."
smnxxw1zuu,11466,dont care for the purple hue otherwise nice
pu0ooms1c2,11467,nice capture. teh white on the stones contrasts effectively with the blue uniforms
w32lpf0xrt,11468,"it seems pretty grainy as well, and in my personal tastes, grain doesnt work so well with color, so black and white may have been a nice idea."
axvgcp6se1,11469,"good cementary feel to this and finally a picture in colour very nice, i like it."
axvgcp6se1,11470,"very military like. im liking the idea, get sort of an army of darkness vibe. great job"
i3w9au46ii,11471,"unique and interesting, a little too much blue filter though."
bvhhnvvqil,11472,very nice. unusual use of orange i like it.
bvhhnvvqil,11473,i really love this shot.probably because it reminds me of the one i captured in puerto rico. wonderful exposure.
bvhhnvvqil,11474,beautiful capture! the tone is a little too blue for my personal tastes.
yfg4asssen,11475,"quite beautiful, the debate will remain whether to have gone all bw, however impressive enough for a good bump."
yfg4asssen,11476,a little busy for my tastes but love the light and lightiing.
yfg4asssen,11477,"very nice, the splash of color and light is great"
ljzaagaf7n,11478,"lovely photo. it captures sorrow with grace, and the colors are gorgeous. ohh, you did such a great job with this photo!"
ocotws1ecb,11479,feels a little heavy handed on noise reduction.
ownehc3vys,11480,interesting choice of colors. definately original. this photo seems very hellish and creepy which is great if you ask me.
ownehc3vys,11481,i like the use of the color burn here.nice image!
dxel4vips6,11482,"lovely image, but looks like way too much neat image was applied"
4prnefc7f6,11483,nice mood and great use of bw
mg4uc9id63,11484,this is a terrific image.solid as marble.yet delicate.great mood too.great job!
vhg3qhydom,11485,nice contrast and play on names. great coloration.
35txlulr4b,11486,love the photo the stones seem to be blending together i wonder if more contrast would make them stand out individually? nice job!
xj2wneqoj4,11487,"magical mood, nice soft light."
6nib2495pd,11488,i love the color tones and clearness of this shot.nice work!
7nd01pt247,11489,"i can see someones been fiddling with the saturation. doesnt work for me, sorry!"
ksgw9lin3p,11490,"love the leaves blowing around. it makes it interesting and enhances that wintery, overcast feeling cemeteries gives you. i like it."
8inbdl1os7,11491,"perhaps a little oversharpened, but an effective picture."
77ml17ef6l,11492,"kind of ugly noise not the good grain effect, and rather bad colours im assuming that you aimed for a sepia effect here. more could probably been made of the subjects"
77ml17ef6l,11493,dont care for the pink tones but really like this image!
77ml17ef6l,11494,i really like the coloring in this shot.adds a mystical feel to it.
xzbtw424ca,11495,simple.and pleasant to look at. like the composition.i think i would ahve liked to see a contrasty bw more than the sepia.
xzbtw424ca,11496,nothing to hold my interest in the picture. a bit flat.
ohbbg71pg0,11497,"nice, like the desat on the flowers, just a hint of color is nice with the bw"
0bkpeccoyt,11498,tons of mood. like the blue cast. would have liked a bit more contrast.
6mi3avw2pf,11499,awesome light and processing.very eerie and very well done!
3q93jiz68a,11500,lol pity though that you didnt work this marvelous idea out better the white could have been more white and the object is not realy sharp.
7f8v929uhp,11501,beautiful colors make this a stronger photo was these the real colors doesnt matter
dmitrbqsff,11502,"wow, pretty amazing macro work. nice soft, even light and wonderful colors."
dmitrbqsff,11503,amazing clarity and colors. the purpleblue is very eyecatching.
qabdmbk6s7,11504,the hue and saturation seem a bit dull. im sure a bit of tweaking in photo software such as photoshop could have made your greens much more vibrant.
qabdmbk6s7,11505,looks a little blurry to me. the contrast is flat as well. try using ps to increase the contrast.
4ivypugeoz,11506,either oversharpened or not resized properly. image quality is extremely poor
a0d33kjghw,11507,lovely use of bw. great texture detail.
a0d33kjghw,11508,great textures. works very well as a black and white image.
zgg9lg98lf,11509,"nothing wrong with black and white, but in action wed have chosen to have it"
fnxycw8wr6,11510,such wonderful saturation and tones! nice work!
fnxycw8wr6,11511,beautiful nice detail and colour is vibrant i love the bug!
0oig0dl1x8,11512,"i think the levels inversion you carried out here is completely unnecessary, the original is far better. and in colour, i think this would have been a great picture."
eoiizm8gx0,11513,oo i wish that sign wasnt there great use of bw youve really set the mood.
eoiizm8gx0,11514,beautiful! bw was definitely a great choice here!
nr1xgbyd3e,11515,the colours are a bit dull. the photo is crying out to have some colour adjustments in photoshop to make the greens and yellows more vibrant.
i72cpppesy,11516,nice but too gray. did you try using different wb settings?
b2xclm51fb,11517,"wonderful photo, but a real shame nothing is sharp."
v9t258kv93,11518,good colors. i llike it. cheers.martin
djx5nrjjhe,11519,shadows were a bit dark for me but nice idea.
x66306970p,11520,fantastic capture of colour and motion
x66306970p,11521,wow! took me a few seconds to figure this one out. bonus points for the delay factor! love the colors contrasts between the soft blue and the hard orange.
x66306970p,11522,"nice contrasts between warm and cold, sharp and unsharp, hard and soft."
zbba9a1w5k,11523,very intersting picture. the way the shadows play off each other make for a nice bw photo
bdme1v4e76,11524,"very odd compressionlike artifacts. was this a picture taken of a bad printout? a neat idea, but the quality of the digital photo seems to really detract from the idea."
20yub0lit3,11525,excellent photo great pose. the contrast is excellent
20yub0lit3,11526,interesting nude. i like the tones and graininess of the photo.
20yub0lit3,11527,awsome picture! great lightning and burning job
40vsp5w2br,11528,the inclusion of noise is appropriate in this photo. good job. .
40vsp5w2br,11529,i like it great black and white treatment and the noise really adds to the photo.
40vsp5w2br,11530,wow! what a great picture. the vigneting and grain are perfect touches.
uos1yte9tw,11531,light is to harsh. use manual controls so flash is not needed or an alternate light source
uos1yte9tw,11532,"hmm, i think the flash is a bit too much. maybe if there were a different light source, it would look a little better."
oiqoa3dsjv,11533,"imo, this would have done better with color. it looks like the colors are lovely but there isnt enough contrast as it is. of course, i realize that perhaps that is why you chose blackwhite sometimes too much color doesnt show well either."
5rwgogw1hn,11534,this is a very good quality capture. the delicate tones adds to the beauty. above average work.
5rwgogw1hn,11535,wonderful specimen great sharpness and contrast well done
0dz7zhbh3k,11536,"guessing this one is onboard flashed? think it would have been better with some other light source, this makes it look very flat. but i give you credit for dead centering and a really annoying color"
n84oz3jqqv,11537,"nice idea, but not well excecuted. a bit too blurry. and having the persons"
agssrkpbj7,11538,unusually sharp without significant halos which is quite impressive! image is also just a bit bright for my liking. nice choice going with sepiaduotone.
wmo74nai1n,11539,"what an odd picture. im not sure why i like it, but i definately do"
3gkgwnevz2,11540,"lightingflesh tones just dont seem to be appealing. also the tip of the womans nails just seem too bright, maybe if they had been painted red would make them stand out better as being different"
js6ekec0bo,11541,nice and sharp with lots of detail. centring is nicely done.
8y2al0t0lo,11542,fantastic. a perfect saturation of color. bright but not over done.
u5rd4avypy,11543,exposure problems with way blown out highlights and blocking of shadows areas.
nvsolawvu6,11544,"wonderful textures, id have liked a little more detail in the highlights. lovely shades of green."
sakb601tgz,11545,"technically excellent, very vicbrant colour."
lgrg2sjx6a,11546,"a bit overprocessed for me, but a nice pic nonetheless."
lgrg2sjx6a,11547,looks overprocessed. nice capture otherwise. i like the black and white choice.
zqia833g62,11548,clever thinking nice image and detail
o3f7a2gjm4,11549,"nice idea the dartboard is too blurry, imo"
82gzev42h8,11550,"wow, incredible. even with so much green going on, everything still pops out"
82gzev42h8,11551,im green with envy!
xtiyzqhxcg,11552,"wow. this image struck me at first, then started to creep me out. the light is gorgeous, but the processing is disturbingly plasticy."
xgf5kzvrj0,11553,"sassy, very sassy. lovely warm hues."
u1u6hafe64,11554,i assume that this was difficult due to the conditions but there is quite a bit of noise in the picture.
mjwvojmo8q,11555,"great find. i wish it was more dramatic in colour, though.or, black and white."
owuourafda,11556,what gorgeous colours and sharpness. good work!
7s74hpnkko,11557,great capture! wonderful feeling of motion!
1w2d2d45rv,11558,zowie. seriously sharp. great contrast.
2l1gbm998i,11559,a little too dark for my taste. everything else is good though.
f1jxdn6ve9,11560,nice attempt but blur is distraction
8f1jqzr3p6,11561,"good macro with vivid colors but it looks over processed, like when we overused a noise removal software."
8f1jqzr3p6,11562,"nice try, but this image, but i dont enjoy or like to look at it. maybe its because the rays arent defined well, or the oranges are so overwhelming, while the blacks arent black enough."
3rv8gcai23,11563,nice job on the selective desat not sure if i like it for this picture though.
3rv8gcai23,11564,"desaturation doesnt work here, since it gives quite a bad look to the surroundings."
q00cc98iz8,11565,a little dark and lacking a little contrast imho.
92lrupbyah,11566,could be a neat image in black light poster.
01zuy5a0qv,11567,"the color, contrast, and pose work very well here."
gtdrfkk2y3,11568,looks underexposed but nice mood
e5a4hysxgf,11569,nice job with interesting tones. perhaps a bit more contrast would help. just my humble opinion.
uxhn9tenox,11570,very interesting use of color and design.
5azvelr1c7,11571,"nice capture. birds are hard to get sharp, and youve done a nice job here."
6w7nory1po,11572,the photoshop job on the lips is little weak. it looks to fake.
6w7nory1po,11573,interestingly artsy. though personally i like selective coloring best when done subtly.
6w7nory1po,11574,colors look totally painted on thru ps. looks extremely fake and a little cheesy.
x8fsextkwc,11575,i am always biased toward macro photos of flowers and this is a great photo. love the colors!
x8fsextkwc,11576,colors and sharpness make this jump of the screen. well done.
m3vh2eompc,11577,"good idea, but the flash makes it look a bit too flat"
q709dv442h,11578,"wow, i love it! the iridized look, the pink and green.lovely."
ggveeonxni,11579,way too overprocessed for my old school taste!
e2eln6mmoh,11580,"this is outstanding, so moving image, aznym. i love the sharpness and colors. cant believe your grandfather was not among the highest photos."
xz8d6tkuaa,11581,"but a fine piece of photography nonetheless sharp, and good colors."
j258ltf4vw,11582,"postprocessing hurts this image. still, a for the try."
rfq884kwqv,11583,as much as i love trees this photo is way too dark for my taste. just mho
pvcircek4x,11584,"i dont like the lightning here, its not pleasing and it doesnt have any dramatic effect."
xb4x2b3xim,11585,"love the colors, especially the contrast between the rust and the silvery tones. great!"
1hhjwi8z3r,11586,i like the idea but the black borders dont work for me. especially the one at the bottom.
z2yckc208y,11587,the colors in this photo are very striking! nice.
z2yckc208y,11588,"lovely colours, but i think a bit too much motion blur."

qm4iw7ts49,11590,fantastic photograph! the color and tones are great.
qm4iw7ts49,11591,"got a good feeling with this one, makes me wanne go off and explore the world. like those old days colors."
qm4iw7ts49,11592,"i love this. i love the tone, and the mood, and the color. gorgeous!"
4mt9iasz1u,11593,"excellent capture, the shadows are a bit dark imho."
wjbjz8st87,11594,theres too many flowers. not original. and why are you asking us if its black and white? cant you tell?
8xka3dev9a,11595,the noise adds an interesting feel to this. though i think that the clean image would have its merits also.
hwgl5bjfy3,11596,not enough contrast on tis imho.
qws8sdnurc,11597,"he looks a bit oversharpened maybe. but otherwise, i like this image. great colors and contrast especially."
8t6b1pjctt,11598,quite a lot of digital noise in this

8t6b1pjctt,11600,"veery noisy, otherwise cool"
yx13svmjlc,11601,"good comp, fits the chalange well, could be a little sharper"
ybqqtx9aid,11602,"i enjoy the contrast, black and white is an excellent choice."
ybqqtx9aid,11603,"good on topic, but looks to sharp for my taste. some vignetting would do the picture some good."
bk3dspdd93,11604,very nice colors and crops. great effects
oo28t43ag1,11605,i like the pp! nice colors and intensity.
zyi9m82h36,11606,i really like the color of this picture. how did you vreat such a drip? i have been taking pictures of drips for years and have never been able to capture a drip this clear and colorful.
j30ug1sw3d,11607,the light is a little blown on its beek but it has nice colors.
tozdhbeqfk,11608,nice experiment with light.
y2foohjwu8,11609,"cuties! the color seems way off here. did you check white balance, hue, saturation and levels?"
0jeu17aq0h,11610,very nice use of contrast and light
fqqso44n2x,11611,the bottom of the float is too dark neat float though!
i6ln88wk1g,11612,"this is good, but i think it could have been greatly enhanced by some brightnesscontrast treatment or a colour saturation twizzle."
ys9lsanusn,11613,"love the texture, color and tone. wonderful photograph!"
ys9lsanusn,11614,pure delight. sepia totally works.
ys9lsanusn,11615,i really like the way it tilts a little bit and the tint is perfect.
jwzassctdd,11616,what a roll youre on! very nice tones and texture in this.
jiy7lpnfgf,11617,"still a tad noisy. wow, i really want this to have neat image!"
gs6m9yoynu,11618,"georgous. it is a little hard to discern detail, maybe a little too much going on."
0vmbjaispv,11619,lovely clarity and treatment of colour.
ueoeitj2cl,11620,nice capture of the light rays.
ce5kxn8d59,11621,"haha, sounds like something from a cartoon d goggomobil."

er651smtg3,11623,"good dramatic action, too bad its a little blurry."
ipy0zqg1nr,11624,"i really enjoy this one, the primary colors, the reflections. it feels like an optical illusion. great choice."
8wbd346f0z,11625,"very cool shadow and image, really good pic!"
x35afzzabb,11626,the crispness and detail on this is outstanding great work
dsy8dp7up1,11627,interesting color scheme. i like your use of shaddows
7jhuildi7h,11628,light is to flat and harsh imho.
mlp8gvslon,11629,i like nothingness. this photo has great nothingness.
bz3yzpsm9w,11630,"i wish someone would do a how did they do that tut on these nice, soft colors!"

r2wbj2t23q,11632,"a neat effect that youre going for, but the acorn is almost obscured"

cyoduzb6yy,11634,"i wish this was a little sharper, would have been a much more striking image."
cdkyl9acut,11635,"very rich colors, but im not sure the whole meaning of the pennies."
cbyddxysfx,11636,this is awesome! bw was definitely the way to go. great leading lines.

usqbkzkgfd,11638,wow. beautiful texture and color.
usqbkzkgfd,11639,great detail! the feathers are brilliant in color.
zwxjo55j0v,11640,it makes me wonder why they polish bullets so much. you are just going to blast them as you open a can of whoop on a poster of a fake dude or a target. you would think that there would be no reason to polish them.
zdngalzpst,11641,that is quite a job getting that slick of red to run perfectly down the blade. well done
gy5yjw0zso,11642,okay. the colors are really nice in this and im going to assume that the blur is intentional.
hqik1ku8hs,11643,very very nice photo. classic kind of feel.
h97beucbk5,11644,this is okay. the white on white is a little bland for me.
azrnm4je2w,11645,would like to have seen a little more contrast and less shadows.
e8we9fa7zl,11646,"theres a touch of a magenta cast in the picture. i dont know if you intended it that way, but im not keen."
uhqai4y1x1,11647,"a little too much detail for the pixels allowed. it does not have a lot of impact for me, but ill bet a larger version, where i could see the finer details, would work much better."
njssx7s0uv,11648,"that is freaky. great detail, masterful photo."
10zt59znu0,11649,beautiful pose and black and white processing.
t1h0all24u,11650,the shadow from the flash is a bit harsh. i think that swiveling the flash might have yeilded a better result.
5ouapxlvv1,11651,i am having a hard time getting my bearings on this image. very good technical photo. good choice of selective desat.
n27kk4xkmj,11652,"bang! this picture really is striking, just the overexposure hurts it final appeal."
zel6n4z3nk,11653,very rich colours but big sharpening halos.
57owvlc8us,11654,"this is quite lovely. soft, very springlike, joyous even in that wonderful spray of pink."

ad9wy6knfy,11656,soo pretty and calming. love the colors.
ad9wy6knfy,11657,nice and carm colors great
q8r1n3z4c6,11658,"as far as editing. i didnt do a whole lot because the pic turned out nice, but adjusted hue and saturation. i increased the shadows and decreased the highlights. tweaked the contrast. then, i did a heavy sharpen, probably too much."
0c1jns5j55,11659,who the heck is the ghost preacher?
ggcefvreya,11660,this is a very nice photo with cool colors. very nice.
ggcefvreya,11661,the different colored lights provide a nice variety.
4xce2qd153,11662,this really pops! the colors are wonderful. nice pp.
psxz3bjloz,11663,"this is good, but the shadow across the front edge is a bit offputting"
gdjaqvbr38,11664,"yikes! love how the little critters legs are just barely poking out. although, their ability to hide in odd spots is one of the things i hate about them. you did this with your spectacular knack of vision, love it!"
5xnf8j6czm,11665,nice sharpness. what a great look.
zwbrpd7l9g,11666,nice d effect but contrast in the exposure could be stronger.
8z7f5nbj59,11667,very noisy image. perhaps turn your iso down a bit and use a support?
ciu22nuhom,11668,the light is a little bright on the lemons
rddefoc1dw,11669,awesome. i love this. i see absolutely nothing wrong with this and see no reason not to give it a ten. great work. very impressive.
m4q4bygmlu,11670,hi shez i love how soft and pretty this looks. makes you want to touch it and see what it feels like. beautiful color!
m4q4bygmlu,11671,"seems to have a visible amount of pixelation. could be because of so much detail into pixels, and lots of compression was needed."
h2yo4clvis,11672,very quick falloff. the colors are amazing though.
7zq2tc9773,11673,"precious capture, bw works well here"
opovcrvg7w,11674,i like this one. you have managed to get nice bright colours in the exposure
35jkdf64ky,11675,the red shorts are a little to over saturated. imo.
a3osgqtv0v,11676,nice colour and setup. an interesting image.
a3osgqtv0v,11677,"the colors being so harsh are the only thing that stops this from being a ten on my books. but, i like it very much."
epqfjdw1o6,11678,i love the excellent color and the soft natural light.
v3jxfnoqcf,11679,nice shot.might want to add a little more contrast to your bw conversion.
v3jxfnoqcf,11680,to my preference its slightly too bright very good quality though
po8du76mx6,11681,wondeful light here i really like the gradation along the stem. elegant
aaxlc7nwsw,11682,pity about the noise in the shadows.
aaxlc7nwsw,11683,"not a bad photo. a little bit of noise, and the colours are tad flat."
qcouudb112,11684,i like this but it is a little wishy washy needs more contrast
010tsheam0,11685,love this backlighting. lots of character.
faqalmgekd,11686,lacking good light and therefore contrast and good colors.
5yli67ddgb,11687,id have used a more diffuse light source to reduce the highlight and harsh shadow.
4pajiigejw,11688,"it is almost spooky. very cool, excellent true to life color, well done."
a077fdj531,11689,perfect sharpness. very nice capture.
1gb4mye95j,11690,very nice image. the sharpness is incredible.
lf0ct9p4j0,11691,seems a bit dark and maybe this was the intent. its a very good capture though.
yywpixarcl,11692,i like the grain and the glow of the light it works for me!
yywpixarcl,11693,redemption? a bit too overprocessed imo but i like the message here.
a04urqzxdl,11694,perfect. just absolutely perfect if that light was on.jk well done.
gbufnwl6ln,11695,a little windy that day? it makes for a unique portrait. i like it.

fc38ve0cyf,11697,very nice yellow and green colours.
cwk94m9f8g,11698,"gritty, intense light, angles and lines that work together i like!"
pn6bfegqbc,11699,wonderful capture of the textures and colors.
suc0qbzpta,11700,a blurry mess escapee?
8asohky5kk,11701,i like the lines and squares contrasted with the natural curves of nature
hpaa5s38cf,11702,"nice photoshop editing, love the colors."
y2egt2k6qs,11703,"wonderful detail, the texture is amazing."
yxpfq24eiv,11704,way too much blur! sorry
db6shlkxw5,11705,"its been done before, but not this well. i really like the complementary blues in the dishes. and its so perfectly sharp!"
k5yz37e2rl,11706,nice macro . a wee bit too dark though
77jl202b16,11707,"this is beautiful, clouds are just amazing. nice control of light! bumped it to"
geqel15cez,11708,superb! lots of nice detail and very nicely done. well deserved blue!
jtefmmuerb,11709,personally imo i dont like pictures that use flash photography it has such a blare of light in one place
w3y94p4v4q,11710,nice effort here. try and boost levels and contrast in ps i think a few adjustments would improve this image
h7figt8n0g,11711,i like the way the girls direct the viewers site line
anod20w5ja,11712,"although a macro soft, it is a bit uninteresting."
2uo11uoxko,11713,"neat.looks like something you would see on an old s record.the colors are vibrant, ."
488uts2po4,11714,"to me the shadow distracts, but otherwise a good capture"
owldgemw05,11715,"excellent work on the conversion for bw, very smooth. a from me."
gmka83r8pn,11716,a great example of bw in color. nice job.
2kutj56i5i,11717,"it does look like an u.f.o. nice colors and clarity, ."
19k2orr2tv,11718,"you got a bit of noise going on there. its a little underexposed, was a flash used?"
551kendrwb,11719,possibly the most wonderful hdr ive ever seen. . solid.
tbrn4mazia,11720,this is a classic. her pop of orange and red amidst the leaves is just terrific.
tbrn4mazia,11721,a wonderful splash of color among the more muted tones.
y5kaxn8137,11722,"great capture, just a touch grainy on my screen"
wn93dza4n2,11723,"nice leading line, great comp, colorsclarity are great, ."
t8wq25ew2g,11724,"its to bad the string is so obvious, good idea, i like the contrast in colors"
2m8sa7tuk9,11725,"comes off somewhat flat looking to me. i think some appropriate adjustments such as curves, saturation, contrast, sharpening could give it a bit more snap."
c09mdj2jy6,11726,nice capture you have enough detail which makes this quite interesting
c09mdj2jy6,11727,in advanced editing i would probably lose the green light. either way it is an excellent study
69h85a7jwg,11728,"great image, excellent focus.very, very sharp"
4lslhm4zkh,11729,"nice colors, image is a little noisy, ."
ctlt7h4bxf,11730,great colour and detail nice work here
xyttdpluub,11731,i can almost feel the velvety texture of the petals.
xyttdpluub,11732,"beautiful luscious red color, with what looks like dappled light."
xyttdpluub,11733,lovely colours and contrast. topnotch.
xyttdpluub,11734,the softness really makes this image. nice rich colors.
0nbfxs5r2v,11735,"neat, too bad about the white screen.neat colors and capture, ."
s0ea85vy9b,11736,the whole image seems to have a reddish tint to it . was your white balance set correctly?
kgscjsc1ad,11737,"arrgh, more light godammit! could of been a great image."
4yrgajx54p,11738,great texture. did you try a little extra saturation on this?
8cekp3ej9v,11739,this somehow seems a little grainy and lacking in sharpness fuzzy. or am i getting bleary eyed looking at too many images?
ldrgd45r7h,11740,"sure the graininess looks old, but so do all the elements within the picture. well done."
ldrgd45r7h,11741,i like the choice of bw and grain. good comp.
ldrgd45r7h,11742,great use of grain and bw!
ldrgd45r7h,11743,good idea but too much grain imo and the shoes look out of sate for the era not scuffed enough
tfjuz2dflz,11744,"good cropcomposition, and nice orange."
ee050qao4e,11745,for me a bit of sharpening as a last step would have added a bit of pop to this image.
d42ionb903,11746,now thats a weak link. very nice to see something different!
7kqbwedhln,11747,i like the dont mess with texas bumper sticker this is a fun picture.
rvx4z4kgcu,11748,the rich browns and grays combined with the shadows help set the mood while the contrast keeps things a little more dynamic.
hqmmnnfenf,11749,"lovely image deb. just super. delicate, soft, hard, shiny. well done."
hqmmnnfenf,11750,like the difference of textures and the contrast. great idea.
2zgm91xyua,11751,i like the captured motion and the colors. nice detail.
w5umdxf30f,11752,ths is really good. i love the texture and the rich rusty tones in this. great job!
w5umdxf30f,11753,nice choice of selective saturation. cool pic!
kck0ur1dwk,11754,looks really wild. more graphic artistry than photography but its interesting to look at. good job.
kck0ur1dwk,11755,wow neat image. curious to see how it was donewhat is of!
v5dh812h9n,11756,i like your use of the lines and coloring.
4lqfmu50yi,11757,wow! wow! wow! what else can you say! oh. . . except congratulaions on a most obvious choice for blue!

a2w7s9mrxz,11759,good comp and cold light
ttp64c1lxo,11760,"good picture, but a bit too much neat image, i believe."
ja1tsrex0k,11761,i really like the use of filter with this. nice and different.
23m1xkm4ea,11762,nice to see something a wee bit different. would of benefitted from being a bit sharper and slightly more contrasty.
ei0l8vvtp2,11763,"good idea, good execution, maybe a little flat in colour though?"
pxpwtklnrl,11764,jeez louise you outblurred me! nice blues! nice brown!
nca1v7h8us,11765,very good. bw is the perfect choice.
nca1v7h8us,11766,i like this. straight line and curves make for an interesting photo.
cer4d95dw1,11767,"looking at this again, im pretty sure its amys. you have done really well with this my equal pick for the blue."
lcd17q1d0k,11768,"the putti kind of pulls me out of the dream, but otherwise a gorgeous photo. great light."
cao2gkaril,11769,this is a nice one with good bw
de1uvzqe2q,11770,"with so many color variations, i wonder if it might now have been more effective in black and white."
de1uvzqe2q,11771,this could be so much better with some basic colour correction.
h9kndj3418,11772,love the fading and color selection!
eqyc1iemrs,11773,"are you using a rd party application for your bw conversion? i love the look and have longed to know how to capture that contrasty look, but dont know if i have the tools to do it."
eqyc1iemrs,11774,i love this capture of lines and curves. interesting contrasts. i like the almost cartoon like effect that you have here.
eqyc1iemrs,11775,"clever and well done. the bw conversion is, of course, entirely appropriate."
bguvptcj7b,11776,"nice red glow, foregrounds a bit dark."
k71bdoxww2,11777,i adore this. beautiful smooth tones. great mood.
7pg12eg2fi,11778,very nice processing. i like the colortone and the gritty feel from the grain.
t64cnb41gm,11779,interesting setup. bw perfect choice for this.
zyutvvffru,11780,beautiful light and choice of colors
zyutvvffru,11781,"great setup, processing. the orange is amazing."
meb5dtxg2o,11782,i absolutely love the light in this. your models pose is perfect.
5yjzj2az49,11783,i love monochrome type pictures like this. i should do some!
vyd41urudv,11784,i like the puke color. grin again and the image itself. well done!
pj6d3b7kh1,11785,wont be too happy to see this as she suggested it. writing looks a little soft and not sharp enough
1nw8r26bpl,11786,"that is just too cute, what a great idea, and love the pink color"
eo4w9o9qw2,11787,"love it! fun, fun, the touch of color is terrific."
0o0crv9hnf,11788,lovely macro and use of light to emphasize the textures. all the pieces seem to have the faintest of red in them. white balance off a bit maybe?
w12d8a9ev6,11789,"may not be your kind of thing, but your gentle use of color along with your expert use of white make this a delight to look at and enjoy."
9f1ov3aqg6,11790,"oh, very cool, roseanne! i love the artistry as i always do in your work!"
ceekya3ahy,11791,"i like the contrast here, and the very bold colors. nice, gritty image."
aay5iryr0l,11792,this glowy hdr look bothers me
1e0j36q19q,11793,im wondering if this would have worked better in bw? still great comp and idea
gkivkufj0q,11794,nice and pink. my choice for red.
gkivkufj0q,11795,very fminine prsentation. very soft.
s530tjxv1n,11796,wonderful job. lovely color and very sexy!
e9ckfvx0ae,11797,nice pic. shadow is a bit over powering but over all a nice clean image
e9ckfvx0ae,11798,hehe. btw very nice touch continuing the shadow on the way way to pay atannetion to detail!
e9ckfvx0ae,11799,cclever and odd but great idea
7jm1cevn0u,11800,terrific use of light. subtle. this looks like an idnic image. d
9a7ig4wpnm,11801,a little dark and nice cheat on the x totally counts wish i had thought of it.
whq8d0c0v1,11802,hard to make out the required sujects in this coloring.
o7xfr178em,11803,"very neat. i know who this is. ill see you in st. well, youll be there not me, hahahaha."
nnescmzt0f,11804,"well setup. the mirrors seem to dark, i like the idea. cool shadow."
5h8a4yurq5,11805,"to be honest, this is pretty dull. i see more mess than chaos really."
4jse9qeyzs,11806,good colors with the rusty brown and blue. clouds add a lot as well.
4jse9qeyzs,11807,"i think the motion is what really impresses chaos upon the viewer. without that, it looks very ordered or maybe textured id a better word"
1xmwiyterm,11808,"real chaos, looks great in bw, the lines and numbers really finish the photograph!"
usvv23bedw,11809,remarkable clarity. engaging colors and tones. get a wow! from me!
enfj2mnm2m,11810,"nicely done. not sure about the chaos, but i like the photo. the greenery is nicely enhanced by the whitish rocks."
939pscvx6r,11811,sorry. i have to look at my mess everyday.
t66xd39v5t,11812,i thinkk this is much too mild a picture to depict anything as fundamental as heaven and hell. the change of colour is not enough. but i like the image .
b3191cwygg,11813,this is really great i love the coloring this better win!
as8snxzcti,11814,nice use of controlled motion to create an interesting abastract.
slyb5t3p79,11815,"nice photo, well executed, great color no chaos i cant really even see and chaos colorwise. a four for the effort."
slyb5t3p79,11816,good color and clarity. interesting picture.
gl8gb5ytcx,11817,"wonderful photo, great contrast and color choices."

agckbx9p76,11822,good job! clearly shows chaos. black and white works well. seems a bit grainy.
ziuvtg72sk,11823,it is a chaotic array of colors
5e40ejkovf,11824,it is messy to chaotic. i dont loke the lightning and the good for record taste
mvnje470ms,11825,"i love pictures of texture and walls and what have you. i dont know that i feel much in the way of chaos here, though. i get texture, and possibly decay, but not really chaos."
1pdw8o0tm8,11826,"oh, what a mess. good example of chaos! great job."
x9ty532tnt,11827,i love the detail that is seen in the hands. they look like hands that have seen hard work and are now ready for some fun and relaxation. i love the darkness in the photo as well.
54dfjh9c0g,11828,i can think of a good handful of ways that could have been used to make the squiggly one bright. im curious what you used.
rx2yu3zhdt,11829,this picture is a disorganized mess. good job!
loi8qoauj2,11830,beautiful image! grats on the red!
lonpmo5xhr,11831,interesting. the different colors of the pinheads are very cool.
8dxyicnl2e,11832,"love it! great idea, great foto, great colors! i give you a ."
th53qe79wa,11833,this chaos is almost pure. i give you the posthumous blue for a stunning unreconcilable image.
lpevlmiavh,11834,i love the amazing coloring and gorgeous contrasts here.
vtuttrsgii,11835,this is a great display of an unorganized mess. great picture.
rq614hp2qt,11836,could be much sharper. good feeling of chaos though.
9bna76m1et,11837,im not fond of the blue tint over the photo.
9bna76m1et,11838,those guys looks pretty relaxed for a chaos atmosphere.
8vuclopdju,11839,"fascinating foto, but a bit disturbing because it reminds me of the vision distortions that come with migraine. but i like the colors and the effect."
x82rrf21d3,11840,"i like the choice of bw here. without it, he details would be lost, and it would look like a green mess."
kaxijxxkpa,11841,"beautiful image. wonderful amber tones, the softness is wonderful."
57feindxz5,11842,"the shadows really add to the dark, creepy, chaotic feeling."
qngqtomxsi,11843,"i love the color gradient, but not sure this conveys the message of chaos."
by8bmkni2k,11844,you have captured the movement of a good break. the colors blend together nice.
yih18457ki,11845,"i like fuzzy llammas, but all i see here are the ducks of chaos."
a257f8tifk,11846,"this is one of my worst nightmares, so it adds to the chaotic feeling a bit. i hate crabs! black and white fits this very nicely."
a257f8tifk,11847,thats a mess. what are the crabs thinking about now? great picture. great job!
3zrlwc66cp,11848,amazing photo. briliant use of shadow
3zrlwc66cp,11849,exelent control of lightning!
k52lgiuc8q,11850,"somethings off, white balance problem possibly?"
bnr8tsv2wk,11851,"very nice. good colors, good originality! very scalvertesque."
79seeq9eym,11852,i like the color and the crispy edge! the signs of yesterdays suicide!
23782kpl8m,11853,"oh chit! you got slapped in this one. good photo, but probably a limited audience for the specific punch line."
23782kpl8m,11854,i dont really get this. is the rake shadow the oldfashioned way and turning to new technology the cheating way? thats what im getting from this pic.
23782kpl8m,11855,lovely colors in the leaves. would have liked to see this taken late in the afternoon for softer richer light.
i34ur5x2oe,11856,"very nicely composed. like how the chips, while in shadow, pop out at you with the white details."
1pzl1s219n,11857,exposure is a bit off. your dark areas do not hold any detail.
2ln04ujeib,11858,"its a classic! one of those, why didnt i think of this! photos. would have worked even better with adult models, but it is sweet enough like this too."
2ln04ujeib,11859,"it has this candid feel, wonderful, warm process and the sweetest idea."
2ln04ujeib,11860,"great capture, not sure i like the sepia, i think bw would have been better. great picture either way"
2ln04ujeib,11861,"awesome! the idea is great, and the duotone turned out excellent too. !"
2ln04ujeib,11862,"love the idea ! and the colors, evething captures the theam perfectly!"
2ln04ujeib,11863,"very nice, i like a warm sephia color cast."
5r4ligsqn4,11864,"great idea, love it.focux is just too soft. and colors seem like white balance was off somewhat. great job though. ."
5r4ligsqn4,11865,"i love the basic idea, but the realization is a bit weak. could possibly benefit from postprocessing levels for a richer color tone and a bit of sharpening, for example."
lhxims5p0g,11866,clever and well lit.surrounding darkness makes it sneakier.good work.
nuxmupeie8,11867,holy crp! thats hot!
mvcfyhyyty,11868,i havent got a mathematical mind so i dont comprehend this formula but i agree with your message. well done and very neat preparation to transmit your opinion.
qvx68m4j1f,11869,great idea! i would have like image to be a little sharper.
0zeobc58be,11870,grats on the blue. this is a fun photo
vgyqnak67u,11871,i think the distant letters should have been the blurry ones.

k8pmzft4p4,11875,great clarity and colour. stunning result.
0hqp8r21rv,11876,"well composed and exposed, good detail. looks like it could be an add in design news."
c245ijqeuq,11877,"it would be nice to see some laboratory equipment rather then construction stuff. but, if you say its a secret laboratory then i believe you and i like your photo and the quality of it"
c245ijqeuq,11878,"lol, come on, are you kidding? that does not look as a chemistry lab.i will give you a just for the mood you have created with the desat and duotone."
c245ijqeuq,11879,"nice photo, the colour works well, but doesnt say much about chemistry to me"
bbk0buusr6,11880,nice capture of a lab. good comp and ellection of duotone.
dcwfr92r5d,11881,"not sure about the blue tone, but otherwise a good picture."
9clq0vujqz,11882,great quality image. the subtle colours are really pleasant. on my computer screen there is a little parallelogram distortion.
9clq0vujqz,11883,"beautiful capture of bubles ,sure wish there were some colors"
7hqeu9bbzk,11884,i like this! i love the noise here and the bw conversion. gives me the feel of an old chemist.
q3pjltaurd,11885,looks like the work of a mad chemist. good colors too.
0f9kkdt7tn,11886,brilliant idea! a little bit soft for me however
k9uek19d2m,11887,nice color tones! what a great picture.

ysthndk2cu,11895,"i was going to take a picture of one of the rides at the carnival here, but it rained the whole time. good job. i love the colors"
ysthndk2cu,11896,wow i really like this one. good colors and motion without bluriness.

c9ybsvh4fk,11900,"bright vibrant colors, wonderful sharpness. bamartin"
dkfkohsx3o,11901,beautifully done with the blurring to convey two different phases in life. wonder how you did that. will revisit this lateron this week. prelim journey
t0ucnpoj74,11902,a little bit of everything.when even practical skills could be fun. like the mellow tone.
t0ucnpoj74,11903,"beautiful, serene image. love the yellow tone of it. image seems a little soft. prelim journey"
t0ucnpoj74,11904,i really wish i could use snowshoes if thats what they are. i really like the warm feeling to this. .
vii42o0dd1,11905,this is a really neat picture. bw makes it even better but its supposed to be without children so i subtracted a few points for that. .
l39tn9x666,11906,i really like the sticks in his scooper upper. great use of colors. .
l39tn9x666,11907,"definately depicts childhood. good job, love the colors. maybe a bit bottom heavy."
3dqzcv1xe2,11908,"super bright colors, terrific!"
rbwd5m5pf3,11909,i like this idea.nice composition.simple. would like it a bit darker and more saturated in colorbut thats me.
rbwd5m5pf3,11910,"i like this one, the yellow boots really stand out in the picture. super."
fd5vzs4ivg,11911,"i really think this would have been a superb picture without filters or effects of any kind. the idea is bold and original, but the colour makes it look a bit like an orange. i am really sorry if that sounds harsh, but i really think you had a winning idea and shouldnt have added anything"
fd5vzs4ivg,11912,the solarize filter doesnt do much for this photo. id like to see the original in a black and white maybe. .
fd5vzs4ivg,11913,perhaps you went to far with compression? kb is well under kb and it shows. quality is horrible.
ymt0e1h9oj,11914,this is a beautiful photo. i love the triangulation created by the lines here. this is also an excellent black and white. i can definitely see this photo mounted and framed jmsetzler
ymt0e1h9oj,11915,i like all the lines in this photo. i think the bw makes it even better. i would like to see it in color if possible. .
u2792ad7vn,11916,good resolution. good memories.
g5xfq5njjx,11917,"the colors on this seem a little muted, they do not pop as i feel they should. i am not sure if you did this intentionally or not, and its just a personal opinion."
rw38jzahnm,11918,"perhaps photoshop could help warm the photo. i feel that the color, is almost as unatural as the light source."
rw38jzahnm,11919,this touched me. was that really given to you when you were ? it looks like new! sweet! i like the contrast of colors and the old chairlooks like grannys too!
rw38jzahnm,11920,the dark and white is a nice balance
rw38jzahnm,11921,"very nice, very soft picture. i ike the offwhite of the bear and the dull red of the flowers."
25k0nnmzyx,11922,something about this grabs me. the cool skythe awesome colors in the bubblesi love it! amitchell
25k0nnmzyx,11923,"this is something i hope to be able to photograph in the future. you have captured carefree quite well in the bubbles but, some of the clouds being so dark gives the picture sort of a sinister cast. syamjonmimi d"
25k0nnmzyx,11924,wonderful! very nice bubbles! great color! this has a wonderful feeling.
58cc9d88rn,11925,its a pity the butterflies are so dark.
yp98oqli93,11926,"thie photo draws me into it, love the lush green color, peaceful and inviting"
lr7fq60gwb,11927,"i dont know that i could. this is both thought provoking and interesting visually, with the repetitive nature of the pairs of supports and shoes. good colour too."
y4qf7ub7nj,11928,nice arrangement and very colourful. floyd
2o54o2wk44,11929,"love the idea but the blue tinge isnt appealing to me, though i appreciate it may be deliberate."
2o54o2wk44,11930,"gumballs usually come in such wonderful colors, the blue hue tones that down too much."
ty7yrhiwxu,11931,maybe if you put the dino in front of the palmtrees and foccused on the dinosaur this picture would be more interesting. like the colors.
b39so8p90h,11932,"dramatic, heart breaking, impact.great bw. sorry for someones loss here."
gywj1o0ffy,11933,very nice colors. image is a bit soft. has impact though. good job.

b9gn91nmus,11936,to much contrast i think good idie
d13zblke9e,11937,wonderful color. nice and sharp. liltool
7bhf8jfnt7,11938,try adjusting the levels in ps because the image looks a little flat
7bhf8jfnt7,11939,i actually entered a swingset picture and then changed it. i love the green in this picture.
iir2dabnz6,11940,you even managed to include an appropriate quotation on the bottom of the comic.
iir2dabnz6,11941,"lmao. perfect interpretation, and original. i love that you can read the comic. and how very appropriate the sentiment is for this website in regards to photographic skill rather than smarts. , justmarried"
938i7qsxv2,11942,needs a little more contrast to make it really pop off the screen. floyd
lckagx5q0e,11943,good job on this one. its so bright and filled with colors i cant help but sit and stare at this. .
b6z2xt7275,11944,sharp picture. nice repeating swings! too bad the front swing isnt in the picture all the way.
asdhiael46,11945,"interesting, make me think of school days. very brave to do bw. certainly learning a lot about using bw like tones"
dfmfvm7yyi,11946,gasp! wow! what a pic! i just adore your colors and the silhouettes make the colors stand out even more. im hoping you make winner. im giveing you a to help ye along.
r3xo1nbbu1,11947,i like this one. is there a filter that you used? what gives it that greenyellow tint? .
wcj0qla54y,11948,brilliant idea. the shadow from the flash detracts a little. over all this is very good.
fpo06vy0ow,11949,"clean, bright, direct. jak"
osaynqutrt,11950,"the colors here seem a bit too vivid. they jump out at me and scream, hey! look! there are colors inthis photo!"
ok2wexr6is,11951,technically very good. my childhood was in color. no memories.
ok2wexr6is,11952,this is great really interesting reflections and i like the bw here. floyd
ok2wexr6is,11953,"i dont know what it has to do with childhood but its a truly unique picture that looks really, really good! it looks like a fractal or something."
ok2wexr6is,11954,"this is a cool pic, it must mean childhood for u but i cant find anything childhood in it for me, but its neat!"
evux6kxjvk,11955,very moving. well composed. in a marked contrast to the year old behind it.
c9n1n5y5kt,11956,thats a really neat beachball. .
3cc684l0c5,11957,i like this except that the shadows on the bear are a little dark. .
yupsrgoqdo,11958,"interesting picture, loved the contrast and colors,also the slight shadows. perhaps more of a random placement of the jacks would make it even better"
70zjqu1oh3,11959,"good link, color contrasts excellent"
zel0pp2fb7,11960,"this is a deeply moving photo. it brings to mind childhoods of the past, specificially from old black and white movies i am thinking to kill a mockingbird as i see this. wonderful job. bamartin"
ib2vl74f6u,11961,i love this photo it is full of colour and movement! all the excitement of the funfair. sulamk
ib2vl74f6u,11962,nice color and definition. the movement has been caught very well.
ib2vl74f6u,11963,now this is my kind of picture. the only thing i would have changed is maybe a little longer exposure time. .
r8ww3c83pq,11964,love the curves in this one. nice light as well. mcmurma
gih38oghbc,11965,looks good. this is good detail. wonderful to see.
gih38oghbc,11966,what a classic childhood memory. great photo. .
ipxqcoqj4d,11967,great color and detail! i tried this idea and it definetly did not come out as good as this one
vtprqchy6m,11968,"well, i definitely am too old for that. i know that now. great picture, love the red of the letters as a contrast to the blue sky.d. o"
zqp5f6byfi,11969,"too neat to be true. this is not really a hurried, unfinished breakfast. i like the idea, but the link with childhood is farfetched."
z6wldgbdha,11970,"i like this. i also like teh white and black cookies, it almost looks like a game of checkers. lennier"
z6wldgbdha,11971,"great idea! i like your use of color and texture, plus the idea is fantastic. great."
7vh13smxuo,11972,oh my. id hate to see the dentist bills! nice color!
j35e5ckmgz,11973,this image works very well in sepia. great childhood photo. bamartin
97icqeebck,11974,"i appreciate that what you did must have been incredibly difficult i am not sure i could ever do it. however, i cant get past the bricks which are blurry."
pkn18b4oom,11975,i really like this picture! i love how its in black and white but it is kind of hard to see the swing. it blends into the trees a little to much but other wise i really like it! good job!
pkn18b4oom,11976,great job! good contrast and use of bw
7usgh67z5r,11977,"i like the motion, but the person in the gocart.does really say a"
f10aru3ox1,11978,"nice clean image, no clutter, very sharp, love it"
gaxe8rfvoj,11979,this has very little contrast as a bw photo
sitjlhf44t,11980,maybe a bit too dark  but thats my taste.
isje1j4rs1,11981,i like the repetion of lines and contrast.
15wdj4mn78,11982,i think the swing should at least have some light.
6ncnflcnvb,11983,why so blue? looks kind of eerie and prisonlike. nice idea but it doesnt inspire me.
llh74lncti,11984,the closeness of the jack is very detailed and adds plenty of emphasis to the page.
7py1p1t5ns,11985,not true i remember that tag line in the uk ads.
7py1p1t5ns,11986,"i really like the idea of the use of dippers, its different and unique, but its kind of plain"
7bbmmlhc1m,11987,sees a little busy for the sepia. nothing stands out to me. i can see some good effort though.
7bbmmlhc1m,11988,it doesnt look particularly sad.more contrast and maybe a cooler tone
jwod7jog06,11989,"yes, thats just the way i remember it! excellent in black white."
elfbn4rdpw,11990,i like how you were able to create a picture with so much texture and so many things going on by only using one color. nice job!
p85phffjs3,11991,great colours. light is quite harsh though. pity.
gnk719weke,11992,nice job terry. this is a very unique idea.
gnk719weke,11993,"very unique idea, i like the hard contrast it really brings out a lot in the photo!"
gnk719weke,11994,excellent in black white. did it work with shoelaces too? i always used a string!
rjpe8vz1ha,11995,"great image! i like the texture, color and movement."
8zquxt8dhj,11996,"nice and colourful, good contrast to all the moody swing shots"

g1jogowf11,11999,love this photo.good detail.subtle light
qiqqvnkkub,12000,very nice. i love the muted colors. this has a very nostalgic feel.
qiqqvnkkub,12001,a ibt too much green for me.
hr573d2170,12002,white balance could be brightened here to make this one pop and scream childhood.
9g3vejyehk,12003,"the colors are beautiful and the detail in the shapes is gorgeous, it just doesnt say childhood to me."
9g3vejyehk,12004,really neat idea as the resulting image has great color.
rtlgnx8hfv,12005,"its a good picture, but theres nothing really unique about this picture."
rtlgnx8hfv,12006,a bit too busy imo. light is a little harsh. nice idea.
pokpxp211y,12007,i like the soft appearance and believe your choice of sepia tone was appropriate to come together with it.
pokpxp211y,12008,your processing works well with this picture. the tone and softness goes well together. nice job!
69fwd2b7bx,12009,"it seems a little too clean to be for childhood to me. i do like the fading lightfading memories idea though, very clever. i think it might have been more effective to use a warmer light though, but thats just me"
jxbu3kw5fj,12010,"after writing the above ive seen your exif. exposed time seconds, did you used tripod? if not this exaplains the blurry image."
rt6ukqugbr,12011,great textures and sepia tones.
0zsdesjjtm,12012,"cute, but a lot of noise"
7w16p26prb,12013,"looks lonely without children. great choice to use bw, let the children add the color."
jlr6eup2rv,12014,i dont really see any bit of childhood just a person jumping. the legs and hands are blurry which makes the whole thing look messy.
8lrbu6wabj,12015,im my opinion the light is too harsh
fi7tec96cp,12016,a cute pose and the bw adds to the image
go5zcwowqi,12017,"nice tones and colors, i really like this image, its a standout. well done."
ebv7d0e4io,12018,"i really like the screen of flowers, and the desat."

mixf914ia0,12020,"cute picture, just a tad dark and i think it would have been better without the borders."
mkrbuj9ij1,12021,color balance seems off too much tungsten?
q2ff7ruuhs,12022,"her gaze is intense. she looks like she is deep in thought, solving all the worlds problems while going on a light stroll. beautiful photo."
4hxzz3u36n,12023,"nice idea well executed, including the epia tone."
4hxzz3u36n,12024,"great job with this.just a little dark for me, but lovely comp"
4hxzz3u36n,12025,i love the sepia. nice tones and great detail.
vgku56ysz5,12026,you have created a very erie and bazziare mood in this image that reminds me of the chuckie movies that were out in the s! good job!
lcppgyruq8,12027,"would benefit from a bump in contrast, imo"
r9uuc2m152,12028,the desat works well here giving it that age old feel that befits the image great job!
0bmuzao1og,12029,lovely study in bw tonalities here ursula. great job
dhm22zqfiq,12030,"na except you could have darkened it increased contrast slightly if you have the software. these should also help to bring out the colour if not, try increasing the saturation with huesaturation sliders."
sw7uet4hh2,12031,"i gave this a . for me, all the important detail is there. good job, deserved much better!"
b1yqdd0ra8,12032,"the photo isnt all that sharp, could be sharper but not too much."
hnwt4eor47,12033,love the backlighting and the vivid colors. very eyecatching!
jeqtamztn1,12034,"selective colour is for advance editing, no?"
jeqtamztn1,12035,"im not sure how you did the selective desaturation within basic editing rules, but it looks fantastic!"
m8y2rcqo33,12036,imo this image is very flat and overexposed. i dont like the yellow colour cast. however it is a good idea. bumped
69a990aqm0,12037,"very nice, clean lines and colourful image."
ftclqw72zf,12038,a little too dark. try changing your light source andor exposure.
ecrwlqij0w,12039,this is just a great capture. good job! perfect shadow and whatnot!
dsl3k3on1l,12040,"i love this picture! very imaginative, good colors, great clarity!"
ujrwc8a68a,12041,if you would have done some saturation and levelscurves on this but obeying the basic rules i think this picture would have stood out a mile. it is screaming potential but just doesnt have that kick.
qh1vyscmli,12042,"quite a unique image and possession is ownership, happiness is the toys attitude,well done."
a2o2fwlwas,12043,"the colors are to die for. they make my heart all melty. i really, really love them."
80z85dkm3m,12044,"great idea, im just not sure about the color choices."
j4fdlygkg3,12045,"looks like you sharpened the picture, so its a little too grainy for my taste."
3i91ckskf3,12046,"very clear sharp image, but its kinda bland. could be a bit more exciting."
jv420jekbm,12047,id like this a lot better if it wasnt turned sideways. i really like the colors and the mottion.
jv420jekbm,12048,good color and feeling of motion. i prefer it unrotated.
9tdnsapio8,12049,"its a pretty good start, but way too unsharp."
oz26zi1dx7,12050,i love the way the colors play together! nice job!
zh80b9cvto,12051,great job my friend! wonderful portrayal here. love the incredible saturation of colors
bxvjp9esxo,12052,i like the bw and the grain helps to make it look old. nice job.
k72i8pevhc,12053,"backgrouns is really hot and busy. a nice idea, but just seems to busy and way too bright"
b2kwohq9z8,12054,"lol great idea and execution. photo a bit dark, but you got a from me for making me laugh."
nemkqivo3s,12055,"i really like the playfulness in this image. the colors are nice, too. ."
3241oyudjf,12056,"its not a horrible photo, and the idea is great. i love the way the light is a gradient out to the darkness, very nice. i just think it needs to be staged a bit differently."
fjpgtwkgsb,12057,the yellow cast really doesnt help this picture.
gqpbv5d0iu,12058,"details are sharp, the glow adds vibrance, highlights and shadows are very nice. you definitely accomplished what you wanted to with this."
gqpbv5d0iu,12059,"although not noticable, the filesize should be as close to kb as possible to minimize compression artifacts."
80ttjt7brb,12060,lovely capture. great use of the light.
80ttjt7brb,12061,"you better have an engineer look at that line, it looks a little dangerous . well done"
8v9pp7hz4g,12062,just a bit more light on the atv
6sj2ibp6nk,12063,nice thought provoking choice of bw allows for imagination. like the bears idea.
6sj2ibp6nk,12064,good imagination. good bw conversion
272r165faz,12065,excellente idea. a bit too dark for my taste.
uo7dbiemea,12066,so cute! love the sepia treatment and those glasses.
dxd35j4pc3,12067,"this is pretty adorable. great color contrast, and i like the shadow."
eocw4otl7l,12068,lovley colors. your setting is nice.
nv32ugqomj,12069,the game maybe even go for sepia? that might have added to the nostalgic feel and gotten you another tenth.
orl6d5mbr0,12070,"crap photo, too much green and its tos sharp"
gchj8a1tvj,12071,"beautifully taken picture, which is made even stronger by the bw conversion."
6tsxy6plcd,12072,"the white one looks coy, the pink one looks happy . . this could be the start of something special"
6tsxy6plcd,12073,"hehe, very nice photo. good colors, shadows, and balance."
z2anb607pv,12074,wow love this image. the toned version works very well. it looks so vintage good job.
qkianwyo8x,12075,very poor quality. sorry. technically its overexposed and it has a.well.nonartistic idea. if youre going for the haha reaction this is not really a good audience.
qkianwyo8x,12076,contrast is too harsh. but cute idea!
o00g8sic2x,12077,clever idea and beautifully executed! love the blackwhite contrast.
mhm4824fbr,12078,"well done with the surroundings, colors are a bit pale."
7fgtrd8p7b,12079,"the aged toys add to your message, i like that. feel like the color and the light is a tad soft"

kof4qp8bgb,12081,"the details say so much. well lit and shadowed, perfect use of the natural colors."
nj4cihstf8,12082,great capture. colors need a bump imho
4yyf9yhv6h,12083,nice sharpness in this image. excellent exposure!
bkizotjryn,12084,i see what your getting at but the picture is a bit blurred and the color on the bikes should pop.
yctqsnps41,12085,this would be great if the colors were more brighter. a little blurry.
yctqsnps41,12086,"contrast, sharpness and color saturation could be better"
4vvv8p027l,12087,i dont understand what the grey oozy stuff is.
1edilgbqhj,12088,"nice use of light, nice tones"
1edilgbqhj,12089,love the sad mood it exhibits. excellent placement of the cards and the feet
75ivtiwosm,12090,"its a bit frontal, the light looks like flames.nice touch."
ts87ipqazv,12091,nice lightning and great effect with the smokemist.
m4tmzygiff,12092,"what is this meant to be a picture of, its just a blurry mess!"
m4tmzygiff,12093,maybe a touch too much blur? the track is a little blurry as well as the cars. id like to be able to make them out a bit more.
i1libw5675,12094,kind of funny with the colored toothpicks.
mxxt8q6ut6,12095,nice colors and great idea! cool!

esaaildwzp,12097,"a childs dream bright, clear photo. i like"

jkwas6n40b,12099,"terrific line, color and creativity. very nice!"
iaag50lar3,12100,great image! well exposed and great light.
2aqvcrlwzw,12101,great! love the blurred object of desire
2aqvcrlwzw,12102,i love the warmth and blur in this image. i wish you had a little eva tho.
2aqvcrlwzw,12103,"excellent color choice and sharp, tasteful plus funny."
5ot8uecs6g,12104,"kelli, maybe color would have been better. if you are happy then that is all that matters."
kn9qpiwgzj,12105,"a little too dark for my taste, but i like the setup and the red."
yb0pf113xv,12106,"that was also a piece of inspired idiocy. unlike myself, you missed the brown by a wide margin."
p0gv634m8p,12107,"what a find! i love the texture too, way cool!"
b68vmhk3kw,12108,im sorry there is nothing stand out in this photo that gives it an edge.
tzvxkkvo3z,12109,"great shadow, bit of blur around the edges that makes me squint, but i like it."
dwtbp8jot1,12110,that is yellow! a little too much for my taste. but all in all a nice picture.
cob6bmpz2u,12111,"wow, thats geat. especially like its in black and white because the starslights shine all the more brightly and evocatively this way."
g9lm6cp7g2,12112,excellent color and clarity. very nice photo!
bki1ci0u7r,12113,"cute idea, but the monkeys seem a bit overexposed to me."
ze5yrn8qeb,12114,hooray! your first blue! and well deserved. yayy ! im so happy for you .
ze5yrn8qeb,12115,thats a great one bw works wonderfully and the croppingframing too. what did you tell or do to the sheeps to make them look this way?
t8hwcvca4g,12116,so i think what will happen is it will be considered overexposed by many. this is always a problem with lcds
kbtm59a2ve,12117,i love this! nice texture. very origional. id give u an
zglia02s4o,12118,"the detail has been created by highlights rather than from the colour of the object. this makes it difficult to look at, for me. nice idea, though."
qd7bpz18mn,12119,"nice pose but the light source is too direct, leaving nasty shadows etc."
jx5siyulvb,12120,truely chinese.very sharp detail
cildcemqb9,12121,im sorry thats just not real good resolution
jtwtjmpnml,12122,"i like your idea and image. the only thing i do not care for is the black viginette, you do not need it."
5zehiodorm,12123,"white balance seems a tad off. unless you were going for an effect, in which case it is probably not off."
2hl4jmspzc,12124,"i really like this one, very original, but i would like to see this image without the lines hanging the figure. but everything is gorgeous, the texture, the light. very nice job!"
mvnzbdzgnt,12125,"i like the detail, this would be a good one for the next challange"
tnd9s2oc6s,12126,i think the scrubby bushes atop the outcrop look a tad over sharpened if you used a global sharpening tool you may wish to invest in something that allows you to selectively sharpen.
ebzpqpi9ih,12127,the colors are a bit flat. some adjustment of levels might have helped here.
l5xdn5g18l,12128,"wow, who could this be? nice capture wendy, love the detail and color. definitely a ribbonwinner!"
b9j3c8e7qq,12129,"neat idea. the chips seem to be sweating under the lights, but that adds sparkle to the image."
zluprstimq,12130,hot chocolate.hot bongo!
pj3lcyi5ve,12131,this is pretty original. the grain gives it something. cool.
pj3lcyi5ve,12132,go on neat image.com and get the free version.
w8a3ua14wx,12133,"interesting, noisy, some distortion a"
mx5l2vn87x,12134,who ate new mexico? neat idea.
21t0yuwhhv,12135,"nice idea, the highlights are a bit blown out on the foil. try a softer light scheme. very sharp."
7oejx4ffv2,12136,tasty. seems to be a fine setup and the image seems pretty sharp and clean. very nice.
q1sppr7p1c,12137,good color contrasts here. the only thing that is bugging me are the fingerprints though.
nxi4l5oa0e,12138,delicious image nice balance and colour
kk0u9djxae,12139,"look good , but way too much noise a"
qh2juuv237,12140,tighter cropin from below and more contrast wouldnt have hurt.
24rr9zurrd,12141,thos new mnms are odd
dom2nozk6q,12142,"harsh light, too much grain or noise."
1wncu06inw,12143,too busy and underexposed in the shadow areas.
r05nn64aca,12144,"very very nice texture, i like the color a. after reviewing all the picture. your my winner a now !"
r05nn64aca,12145,"pretty poky! gorgeous curves, great color!"
uo6so9yye1,12146,very original and perfect use of sepia.
uo6so9yye1,12147,"beautiful portrait, not sure i quite like the colour. b w would probably have been better. but i still llike the idea and the pose."
y5e4tv2yz0,12148,"this is neat, a little busy, but neat. ill say ."
1ociudvpgr,12149,"unbelievably perfect. fantastic job, well deserved blue!"
1ociudvpgr,12150,"good exposure, good timing. tighter maybe?"
1ociudvpgr,12151,dont like the shadow of the splash but the splash it self is very cool.
1ociudvpgr,12152,wow. great timing and nice soft lights.
ro6r0vcrzu,12153,great balance and contrast of light and dark.
inrf7yw2nf,12154,almost a black and white with a hint af brown. geat colour selection
7xlag5xxkb,12155,"perfect exposure. no underexposed areas, no overexposed."
7xlag5xxkb,12156,a little too dark for my taste pun intended
vmzpi03o72,12157,neat and clean. could be an advertisement. good coloring.
9qgriz0j4h,12158,"good idea,perhaps a little dark, but good none the less"
c9vyhv97g5,12159,too dark. nothing gained from being in black and white imho.
c9vyhv97g5,12160,would have preferred colour. b w makes it a bit difficult to see too dark?
c9vyhv97g5,12161,"too dark, i cant see anything. i think i see the word snickers."
6915r9buxb,12162,"brought a grin, but boring. very dark chocloate there"
6q5dt5tslc,12163,seems pretty tasty. more contrast and noise reduction wouldnt have hurt for my opinion but othervise this image seems pretty good and interestin.
rerbfz2sri,12164,so easy to make beautiful black and whites. great picture!
bv0i0jdd13,12165,its wierd to see mms bw but i think its a really interesting image!
bv0i0jdd13,12166,but the best thing about mms is their color!
3ro8mtbg2u,12167,i like the green thinf with the place a
6hduwv33li,12168,clean and sharp. looks like an advertisement. very good.
8oac71spgm,12169,"if i didnt relate so much to this, id find it appalling! good choice to use the bw. i think the photo and idea are both good, but not great."
p8xpvqoe4w,12170,a bit blurry and underexposed. good idea to work on it!
ueb8w1lhhc,12171,interestion. not sure i like the yellow flare a
7kouc99fly,12172,"sort of neat, not crazy about the photo quality"
7kouc99fly,12173,"godd, but the quality of the picture is not there ! a"
7kouc99fly,12174,"i like this photo. however, it seems as though its a tad oversharpened. perhaps its just the quality of the photo. im not sure. i do like the general idea of the photograph, though."
c3mjx78vfs,12175,"umm.k. how about, alot of hot spots from the flash."
qomymajfaw,12176,orange cha glad you chose it? lol
r6wd2fm2np,12177,a little too dark and underexposed for my tastes. appears to be a bit grainy too.
r6wd2fm2np,12178,"seems a bit dark dont think it is my monitor,but a good idea"
slhw6bct25,12179,the yellowish tint make both look unapitizing.
x3rgfeqbbt,12180,"nice pants, you spelled which wrong but thats ok. not very unique."
jimukan08y,12181,its a choice for sure but on this site not much of one! not crazy about the inverted colors.
jimukan08y,12182,"a good idea, not sure about the invert colors though!"
np6pbwqobr,12183,"ha, now this image would be fun to see in black and white. good job. seven"
rwmmg5p4q0,12184,i love it. it has that yugen quality that a photo needs.
5frhqiuyu7,12185,great pov used here. the different elements and colors in the photo make it quite interesting.
b8o9mxegcx,12186,"the white looks ros to me, but either way its not a very original rendition. sorry"
b8o9mxegcx,12187,"aha, the white escapes me here."
kclkehha77,12188,is the brown one not serviced by browns septic service? how ironic p
ga2fha64j6,12189,white balance problem. learn to fix that for the next one. a
arl8nrp71l,12190,good use of light and bw.
6t4jk6iii0,12191,that transparency effect is really neat.id like to know how you did that. very cool.
6t4jk6iii0,12192,very cool motion effect. it gives the photo a very kinetic feel.
kwp3eakflv,12193,"sorry but i have no idea what this is suppose to be, it is just a little too dark of a photo."
kwp3eakflv,12194,this is a tough one for me. the photo is very dark but perhaps that is what you were looking for. for me having it so dark make the photo not very appealing.
pymwg58xx9,12195,another addictave choice! seems a bit hot and not much wow but a great example of choices.
rxdsgk7fli,12196,rather unoriginal and the white sandals seem to be overexposed
towrgxx0l4,12197,"the only think id change, id make it a lot more sterile looking, meaning, i would make it pure white white."
sqm7gj5bqh,12198,a tad grainy and undersaturated. but the women on the cans are pretty enticing.
fr7op2zo5x,12199,"a little lacking in contrast, but i think this symbolises one of lifes hardest choices."
fr7op2zo5x,12200,"this pict. says a lot.the bw really works, but it appears just a little soft. i like the offset of the model and the pose she has taken.well done"
6tz2ef2cux,12201,"nice pic! love the colors, feels like the shoes are popping out of my screen!"
umpeee2m92,12202,"i like the color bars, but wish there was more graphic interest."
rrmo04g8a7,12203,superb pic look sgreat in monochrome.
5l1my39iim,12204,too much motion blur on the girls hands.
cp337za569,12205,the idea is so unique and thepicture is so cool !
nlqyaze1j1,12206,i like it but it is not too pleasing based upon the darkness and th elarge spots of black without must interest in the sunsetrise.
hl8r3pky63,12207,i love the phallic imagery. nice crimson bground. you are a master.
qly1km9aab,12208,"great colors, and a choice my wife makes for me. lol"
216abkfr7l,12209,i like the dramatic artistry of this photo.
pkma6vu0ay,12210,"nice macro. i thought they had thrown out the blue ones but guess not. its a good submission, but im not crazy about the purple splotches between the red and blue mms."
pkma6vu0ay,12211,do the red ones taste better? good macro photo.
xv6olxmol8,12212,"what a contrast in paying methods. old and new, pay now or pay later."
odx67v23u1,12213,this would be a really neat stock photo
odx67v23u1,12214,this is really nice. good work reducing the shadows here are the product on a light boxtable?
odx67v23u1,12215,very good. only minor problems are the pinkish color near the bottomcorners and oversharpening
odx67v23u1,12216,the backlighting is a little too bright and overpowering.good idea and still a good execution.
0kgfm25erv,12217,"there is a lot of color available, more light would pop it."
r387xzq6ym,12218,"lacks temperature, texture and feeling"
r387xzq6ym,12219,nice still life. i like the backlighting. good depiction of an everyday choice.
9qxx66kwsc,12220,"ohh very nice, unique, i love the black and white effect. this is a winner."
j6op58l16r,12221,aw come on dont tell me adam had supersizes! the image itself is very nice effective advertizing. its a little unnerving to have the hands disconnected but the black backgrould works well anyhow.
czwtehqgl1,12222,needs just a smidgen more light.
h71thx8epo,12223,"i love the bright, vivid colors in this one!"
h71thx8epo,12224,nice setup shame about the slight overexposure
h16v59123c,12225,the idea is good. not really sure about the whole setup though. ill take red by the way
sekkl7r0ys,12226,nice and sharp. a bit dull in the colors.
sekkl7r0ys,12227,the color looks a little flat perhaps a tad more saturation.
3etwktw005,12228,good detail and the colors.the colors.ha
h6a9og1k9x,12229,"the idea is a bit obscure. good technique, though."
g8xob60x3i,12230,"kinda dull, would have been better with some deepr hues and more contrast"
ds7cxcqm8d,12231,"i feel like ive seen this picture before. awesome, but its just so grainy. try running through neatimage, maybe?"
pgpad6i56s,12232,great idea for the double exposure. nice.
ufzt9hl30x,12233,"the inversion is a neat idea here, but it doesnt work very well with the shadow of the remote. otherwise, nice execution. i considered this idea myself!"
ufzt9hl30x,12234,"whats with the weird blue shadow? oh.i see, negative image. nice effect!"
ufzt9hl30x,12235,"what is that blue shadow? it looks unnatural, almost like it was a negative wait a minute, the whole image is negative huh? i get it, but i dont like it. sorry"
atdbvzgurg,12236,"i just really like this one, very interesting shadow usage as well."
n1yl4wv7zo,12237,"ah, the ultimate choice in america, lol. only thing i wish was that the white was a bit brighter. other than that, good job."
33ptjzpbm8,12238,nice macro. seems like it could use a bit more warmth.
imzgtxud6s,12239,just a little bit more sharpening would be better. imo.
bfqku1ousw,12240,"idea is nice, but technically it falls short in sharpness and exposure"
66kmbg4aqe,12241,those red marks make the choice really bloody i like a lot.
b1nuf2l1s6,12242,"i like this, its a shame the urantia covoer is white at the bottom though."

pm63x50t0r,12245,great use of colors here. that adds a lot to the photo.
qdhz7rjidk,12246,"technically i think that is a poem, not a song, but i still accept it. nicely setup with a good balance of exposures."
z6pcjtaqsw,12247,quality of the image could stand to be better. but the content is fantastic and deserves a . great job.
mplptma3dd,12248,"well, there ya go! thats just plain lovely. beautiful color rendering, especially."
ddaoomb2e4,12249,"good idea,maybe a bit more light from the front."
ef6mz4ti8y,12250,nice reflections and good exposure. but something is missing.
cx10r5dwwd,12251,noisy and unappealing colour.
ux9xmr8fre,12252,the color is kind of weird on the orange like all in mess. not sharpe enough.
ux9xmr8fre,12253,love the color. too much monochrome in this contest.
bxdbjfdd5r,12254,good contrast. in all senses of the word.
jrmg6hmk8f,12255,"nice idea and arrangement. sharperclearer would be better, i want to make out more detail in the buds."

rwkdew1eee,12257,"kewl shot!i really like the light, its has a really nice quiet quality about it.the colors are awesome too."

w8h3ntm218,12259,nice asymetricl balance. the lines really look good

03aiv0t487,12265,"to be honest, its tough to figure out whats going on in this image, and the quality could stand to be improved."
lid0cst8db,12266,too yellow! also too much local contrast makes this look over processed.
3e407dr8ns,12267,congratz on your rd place. i like the brooding and dark atmosphere as well as the pov.
3e407dr8ns,12268,technical way too flat undercontrasty
okhjal14b3,12269,"black and white was good choice for this photo, could have played with the ligthing more to give it that sad forgotten look."

pg8d2sf2z0,12279,technical a little soft and some blown highlights.
92ng4opqq0,12280,nothing blown out here at all. sepia ? yes? nice mood and presence. great photo.
art0as5x2k,12281,but wait. where are the complementary colors? p

itmd5gebs3,12287,"looks like youve used an artistic filter. nice idea, but i would have prefered to see it without the filter."
jn68u3jcgi,12288,the colors look a little bit flat. maybe a curvessaturationcontrast adjustment would have made this pop.
jn68u3jcgi,12289,pretty but too busy for my tastes. it makes it flat and hectic.
jn68u3jcgi,12290,"seems to be a little lacking on the sharpness, i like all the different variety, the colors are nice."

gwri2jhrjl,12296,neat.good distribution of the colors.
gwri2jhrjl,12297,very pretty. the blending of those colors in such a soft way is beautiful!
f45pta4ee7,12298,super idea. hot spots are just too overpowering! bol
f45pta4ee7,12299,looks as though youre trying to light things worse than i do and almost succeeding. shame because it could be a nice pic.
f45pta4ee7,12300,other than that it is a very soft image. the over exposed spots this image is fine
r93t11bwux,12301,great shot.good dof.love the crispness of the front one.great color
r93t11bwux,12302,might be just a touch of too much blue you can correct the colors in ps.
jgf3m6bdxp,12303,good color contrasts here. the light really glows pretty.
eb1pytnqul,12304,you captured circles with some fun color
hoqhifd9sm,12305,like it! good choice of coloe tone.
hoqhifd9sm,12306,nice bw portraying an old time mood.
hoqhifd9sm,12307,i can almost feel the texture of the wheels. good job.
iu12rttke3,12308,very cool effect. great coloring.
0e7qvwhia7,12309,good use of lightshadows. i also like the tint.
rldtapwde4,12310,nicely captured! gorgeous colours and makes me fell warm just lookng at it!
v5devdpmqn,12311,"nice touch of humor. beautiful, brilliant color."
po5du4njl0,12312,like this a lot. bol white is somewhat too soft imho.
39dgemi93d,12313,there is a strange leading line within the way cirlces are set out. well captured
be3jm1rm5n,12314,the glares from the overly bright light spoils
be3jm1rm5n,12315,very sharp and clear as well as good color! good job. from me.
v1dqxxvdhy,12316,"i like this idea, i thought of it myself but didn t implement, however, i think color would have given it more impact"
cep30vm1kj,12317,i like it very much! love the distorted effect and the color tone!
56u661edx8,12318,"beautiful. not sure, but i guess it would have looked good in colors also. ."
c1a7hustge,12319,bold and subtle at the same time. love the colours and luminosity too. nice work.
yjckdgqofm,12320,"wow! i love this photo. the sharpness is spectacular, and your use of black and white, plus the way you have composed this is just perfect!"
cx6ud83s08,12321,"too grainy imo, nice idea though."
9qendpqtet,12322,wow! what a contrast in form.good processing too.faved!
h8sssls6ca,12323,very pretty. and the fine detail is suiting. the yellow is over to white. darker would help some.
h8sssls6ca,12324,"nice effort, really pretty. the yellow is a bit blown out."
ucbwzkvo7m,12325,lovely picture and use of black and white. i would have liked it better had it been a little sharper
ta48q1ww5e,12326,"nice motive but it is located so that the picture is a bit off balance, maybe it would have been better to have it a bit more out of balance or not. i am not sure though."
20yt07xy8z,12327,"this is a good idea, but its kind of blurry. the light is also a tad too bright."
20yt07xy8z,12328,i like the sharpness. makes the sweets look tasty. wld be nicer if e sweets were laid out more naturally
lo8sq8ue2u,12329,"i still havent figured out what this is? i like this very much, it is very interesting. the only complaint that i have, is that the image seems a tad overprocessed."
ho7hmjegr8,12330,like this. my own personal taste i think i would have liked this with the dart static and not in motion. bol
2jpq5udx64,12331,positive very artistic. great color saturation.
6ruesytzdu,12332,there is noise in the image and the effect of movemenet is not properly rendered.
jwutpx9lsc,12333,theres some odd antialiasing artifacts in here they shouldnt be visible at this rez. possibly sharpened it too much?
jwutpx9lsc,12334,"good image, but i feel like im lookign at a zoomed in image. i see pixelation on every edge."
gybpst1hiu,12335,"wow, these look a lot like lilikoi passion friut flowers. very beautiful and exotic"
0adc09mebv,12336,needs more detail which a little less exposure might have helped.
0adc09mebv,12337,seems a little overexposed. but good idea to use the cyrstals.
6tio5bv2g7,12338,"ying and yang is all about balance, and yet the green seems to me to through it all out of balance."
z9x57h5u6p,12339,"i like the colors, the bubbles kids world.o"
z9x57h5u6p,12340,"like this a lot, but the color cast really bithers me. ."
z9x57h5u6p,12341,"love the idea, just unsure about the color. seems really muddy to me, but that is just my opinion."
z9x57h5u6p,12342,i dislike the colour adjustment that you made. maybe this photo in its original colours would be nice.
yjdiwg68jd,12343,"lol, nice use of light, though the picture is a little grainy"
hoy8dd4fbj,12344,hmm. nice ripple work.
nwnvp9an23,12345,love the old feeling of this. sepia might be a nice effect.
cb3vtrfp5m,12346,! this is just superb. cant get over the detail and color. and so unusual. i love the use of light and dark.
f3dmpz3vce,12347,nice find and brilliant colors.
f3dmpz3vce,12348,great natural find. thats really neat! nice coloration. not overly exposed.
adrx37gfbj,12349,cool. needs a bit more contrast. great idea.
adrx37gfbj,12350,"why do they have blueish shadows and purplish glow? save for those two things, very good."
u03vg2u7re,12351,very neat shot.great color and crispness.
u03vg2u7re,12352,really neat spin on circles.
7vzn8o3hre,12353,i really like the tones of this image.harch and warm at the same time.
p8cz2e8nxm,12354,"would have liked to see this be a bit sharper, perhaps with a bit more color saturation"
p1810l4z3s,12355,"this is a neat idea, just wish it was in forcus a little better"
nbz44alkgd,12356,wonderful texture and great use of subtle color
pxt9paskxs,12357,almost looks like an andrew goldsworthy project. neat!
ba9gjrkisf,12358,good idea. a bit flat imo.
7ah5pi8aus,12359,would be a great image with sharper focususm
i6j9as2dq8,12360,some interesting desat here. id like to know how you did it.
jeaxuns9s1,12361,lovely color contrast. seems a tad blurred to me. maybe its cause its l a.m. and im tired.
94uxhbt322,12362,"not sure what this is, but it is too light all that contrast wasted without deep blacks to lose yourself in!"
yr682inwn9,12363,"a slightly faster exposure would have frozen the motion better. the white clothes are already overexposed, so you it looks like there was enough light to go faster."
axdf5n92ej,12364,"this would have been better imo if it was bigger, we cant see the detail in this neat picture."
pmklj4d9n1,12365,i like the yellow on blue. how did you do that? was it ps select and change. good effect.
pmklj4d9n1,12366,"very sharp, good rich color, nice contrast."
pog96qynov,12367,"good idea, really grainy, maybe on purpose?"
pog96qynov,12368,the noise adds to the feel of this image. nice job.
l9pujee158,12369,the contrast is good. original idea but not overly exciting.
yky2qwdsgk,12370,"very nice image, i take the time as am, and the white spots are stars."
ygo45fn6s0,12371,this is really cool! only issue imo is the extra bright spots.
h8hf9iog1h,12372,very nice artistic picture.good contrast.
lth8f0nftm,12373,"more contrast would make this very very cool, i still really like it the way it is, nice circles!"
1h15i3r3hb,12374,"interesting idea, but it feels a little fuzzy. i like the duotone finishing."
4o7ub67o1b,12375,i dont see too many circles lots of elipsoids though . great color and saturation really like the color.
0ur73p2k7x,12376,"i like these dreamcatchers a lot, pity about the light at the bottom."
mb0kjht0ub,12377,picture quality is too bad. niec try though.
xdvpra8mop,12378,"a bit soft, was the dreamcatcher moving? or you?"
jo8mqmz8kx,12379,nice colors and clarity. good job!
jo8mqmz8kx,12380,great stock photo. couldnt be more clear or vivid. love the colors.
th5ytjokqn,12381,"the colors, the light, its all so ethereal. i really really like this image! great capture"
th5ytjokqn,12382,"really striking image! i love the color against the black. well done! at least a , maybe more."
kn4rtkir4y,12383,neat shot.beautiful presentation
ygaojk4q1j,12384,your artistry and taste are excellent!
vyw1fsygh8,12385,"i like the texture and color in this picture, however, it would be better if it was bigger."
pyg1dqf83q,12386,"i find this picture a bit bright, but i love the colors. ill give it a . hehe straws."
pyg1dqf83q,12387,wellposed straws. i love the artistic flair of colors emerging from the whiteness.
pyg1dqf83q,12388,e straws are too sparsely spread out. picture looks weak.
39eco2zvar,12389,"the comp and idea are great, but theres a need for more pop in the colors and contrast."
6m91cfxo2q,12390,seems like you have a bit of motion blur. no tripod?
65o09mo26f,12391,a wonderful sharp image! good bw! very nice!
pvhr0a6wlr,12392,not the best pose. are you trying to highlight the models breasts?
toppoqy7c9,12393,"fun idea, but, needs to be way sharper and clearer."
3x3guyur8e,12394,great motion. a little dark for me though. .
msutg6x6h1,12395,the lightingshadow looks a little harsh to me. maybe if you tried a more diffused light source? not sure if that would be better. just a suggestion.
7plejlew0p,12396,a bit bland for my taste. maybe some more pop to the colors would help.
v1gl7ajqxz,12397,light is very dull and there is no pop .
2fpxjt1m2q,12398,would like to see a larger version of this with more visible detail.
7nfl6hiost,12399,i think it would have been neat to see a bit more of the sax im sure other parts were shining too.
puq7fny6jn,12400,"this is really pretty and interesting. i love how the person has a soft, almost ghostlike look. very nice image."
rm8wk9uvf0,12401,what a beautiful take on a watering can. love the blue and green. very nice detail.
c3vqf26sb5,12402,"really nice colors, but too blurry on the outsides"
71qqtgu4dx,12403,"i missed this one on the first goround. its very serene and neautifully toned. i quite like it, a lowkey, not inyourface photograph of a mundane object."
4izoxzpizp,12404,darn that one little light spec! nice shit.
ti21rh7ec0,12405,"are these contruction barriers? lightingfocus is so soft here, i dont know if it really helps."
ti21rh7ec0,12406,very red. not very many proper circles. very soft needs sharpening.
cps4xc5xo9,12407,nice play of hue saturation.
cps4xc5xo9,12408,this is a great use of monochrome. nice picture.
cps4xc5xo9,12409,"bright and glassy, nice look."
j84u38z6p4,12410,beautiful colors they really do a world of benefit to this image.
j84u38z6p4,12411,"visually appealing colorwise, the lenses are a little awkwardly placed but i appreciate the effort here. i like it."
qp0ogj7vpb,12412,i love the contrast of the colors. cool pic.
bhj5c4bkpy,12413,i actually expected many pics like this. i love the motion tho.
88nlb708k1,12414,neat idea.i like the messy colors.
jno8xhbnyc,12415,neat color but the image seems alittle blurry
8bmenlskck,12416,"really like this picture, especially as its not colour. very artsy looking, nice capture"
k7jbuk708r,12417,great colors in this one. couldve worked for macro as well? hehe. good one.
wcs84pizvr,12418,maybe a filter would have deepened the colors on this.or even a sepia tone?
wcs84pizvr,12419,"a little overexposed and the colors look a little bit flat, at least they do on my monitor."
i0ik535e89,12420,"overblown, it were darker there would be more detail visible. good job though"
v3c4mfcvae,12421,"not sure what you are getting at here . nor am i sure that you have captured something. whole image a bit dark, lacking in clear vision."
9v5q5lcso8,12422,sharpnesspicture quality could use some sharpening
wsni0s4lbx,12423,cute. cant help but wonder what this would look like in color?
wsni0s4lbx,12424,"interesting, i never would have thought that daisies would be so interesting in bw. good textures and light."
6p228xi9ew,12425,"this image has a lot of artifacts in it, maybe they are from scaling, maybe from compression, probably both. but it makes the image look rough and pixellated, unfortunately."
t0u6wt256y,12426,would have had more of an effect for me if you could have zoomed in more on the coins and gotten sharper image.
s2fm1h6nnt,12427,"that looks really wierd, i like the color, good relfections."
a7bt5qfhmw,12428,unique! sparklers in a trash can?
6uqxzhoj5g,12429,ooh new favourite so far. super cool or hot.
mlnzz9eb42,12430,different. i like the imaginative approach. great clarity and colors.
uodi7iw7r3,12431,the idea is good.but the overexposure has took over the subject.bear that in mind for next time.well done for the idea.
j8ipd0u9kx,12432,"the colors and light seem a bit flat, but nice capture."
s25bakf2iy,12433,"thats alot of corks, would like to see it a bit sharper, and a bit more contrast"
epzubgeb5f,12434,this is a stunning picture! nice use of color.
hmgvjy6p0w,12435,"this is really nice, bw treatment is good."
jj7gokqvjc,12436,i really like this. its beautiful. youve captured several different levels of light and maintained detail without overblowing the highlights or losing detail in the shadows. really really nice.
5i7ftkdbyt,12437,a little more contrast would have brought out the details on the coins better. plus an adjustment on the shadows and highlights would have helped also.
c852hcgni5,12438,"i like this picture. there is a little noise in the shadows, but other than that its really good!"
t3tqtmjxqu,12439,"great prospective, seems a little flat on my monitor, but still very nice"
o8yvtokp54,12440,i love this picture! very imaginative! the yellow within the orange is awesome!
o8yvtokp54,12441,very nice great colors and superb execution
uzpgu08mcq,12442,nice portrait and great capture on the bubbles glitter and texture.
lp3fzvejth,12443,"i really like this as it is not only funky but colorful, vibrant, ish, and fun tomlook at. also love the mutli neon colored lights."
xyuskuhx32,12444,"pretty picture, cute idea but weak execution spoils it for me."
392ccacqme,12445,"remember seeing these houses somewhere before, such a nice capture and light is just perfect"
auirzz1mon,12446,thats cool. did you get someone to drive by for you or was this normal occuring traffic? great job on the exposure.
97r8tbmaz1,12447,great finish and a wonderful image beau.love the light levels
97r8tbmaz1,12448,"wonderful detail and fantastic colour. excellent, in fact."
97r8tbmaz1,12449,just great. realy well done. rich colors.
akdvkrh10c,12450,"great colours, textures and shapes. a nice detail."
frz5n7bshc,12451,lacks punch. some more contrast and sharpening would help though.
e0pvikubpt,12452,did you get this idea from one of my photos? maybe its a coincidence. nice colors.
e0pvikubpt,12453,"pretty, nice soft colours, cool circles."
t2c553cubv,12454,beautiful picture but somehow i find it quite flat as far as light concern. feel like under exposed.jmho
y856vxkwb4,12455,i like these colors and the design. and you have some nice circles.
ay16dx3jqz,12456,"nice colors, imho, your choice of frames is a distraction."
vslbo4omit,12457,cool! love the splash of red against the black and white.
vslbo4omit,12458,this must be a ralph nevins photo! not quite as sharp as some of your others but its still pretty cool.
43zk6wyex7,12459,really nice bright sharp image good work
8cd2l0pgur,12460,wow karen! this is awesome! the backlighting adds so much pizzaz to a photo that would have been awesome anyway
8cd2l0pgur,12461,"love the soft calming colours and the hard shapes, very nice"
yj25qclz92,12462,very unique pov. everything works.
39ijbwy24w,12463,"excellent yes it has been done before, but what hasnt? well executed, a little soft on the ripples but nicely done."
2kyjvwey22,12464,interesting maybe it work better if the pearls were set on something that had no texture they seem to compete.
7qfi0j3cz7,12465,something about the tips of the straws throws me off. maybe too sharp?
z6tir4kcnp,12466,"i love the texture, detail and coloring in this photograph. nice work."
z6tir4kcnp,12467,"wonderful detail, soft light. i like the color and texture. has a feeling of familiarity to it."
qqgn4ql4tg,12468,"i like the weel circles, good in bw"
o0cv88nh7g,12469,"i love this! colors work so well and are so calming, with that great blue! nice work!"
vk1io1th9z,12470,nice the grain is a bit too much for my liking though.
vk1io1th9z,12471,this presentation will be well evaluated. i personnaly love it. very soft tones. the little girls fits well in it.
xpqojyu3wh,12472,i like these type of images. not sure of the color.
7oemmuu1qv,12473,congrat! amazing mood youve created.
7oemmuu1qv,12474,"im trying to figure out what this person is standing in and i dont know. its a cool photo, somewhat surreal, and i like the green tones."
39w0u1p6r5,12475,"solid colors, good details, not the typical to time . seems just a bit unsharp"
2274x1o2gd,12476,unique and interesting. it is a bit confusing and busy though.
xza4ovmwhs,12477,beautiful tones. good balanced presentation.
wgsdmmxcmt,12478,the colors reflecting off the disk are great! good job!
endqji81xc,12479,"this is so incredibly awesome, not sure at all how it got a . dpcers can be crazy sometimes, this is just amazing though, love the selective desat, really adds a lot to it, adding to faves"
owbrh95yhi,12480,sharp and crisp.name seems very familiar!
ipycznv21m,12481,good pic. like the tones but i would have made it a little darker. in the shadows. more contrast perhaps?
ts14mg8yvy,12482,this is one of my picks for blue. i really liked the concentric circles and the two tone image. very striking.
ts14mg8yvy,12483,"wow, roxanne, you dont have to put on the red light, those days are over."
ts14mg8yvy,12484,excellent i like the colour and texture in this picture good work
e4ljnjnqbz,12485,i love the exposure of this. subtle and delicate.
302xthty96,12486,"i might like this better if there was a little more color in it, or if it was just all the black and white. but this is a really cool photo!"
302xthty96,12487,wonderful! beautiful reflections! the ripple rounds the photo out and makes it wonderful!
vvmo7zgqwd,12488,"cute setup, could be a bit sharper and maybe a bit brighter?"
vse4ddqlvq,12489,"awesome idea! the only thing i dont like is the tiny red and blue splotches. which somehow make it almost look like a d picture without the glasses. perhaps it might look better in black and white. then again, i dont know, maybe you intended to get that effect. just a thought."
b2do5hvbqc,12490,"i like good texture, light, color."
hn5pi5vk75,12491,cant really see the circles. but i think as a photo. a little colours and contrast would be good.
b9ey83ay9b,12492,"nice color, image is a bit boring,"
ag3ztn6sw9,12493,too much motion blur for my taste
ag3ztn6sw9,12494,not enough blur to make it motion blur and too much blur to make it static.
q59bguapcr,12495,very nice capture. i like the effects of the exposure time on the sparks. great job.
5y0kotwws8,12496,look tasty. maybe i should go fix breakfast. cute photo. good detail.
lxo922v0ed,12497,this is really a great shot.excellent exposure.and great colors
r9s9fp6327,12498,really good texture and clarity.excellent job
h4b8pqkxts,12499,this is a fun find. i wonder why someone decides to make a display like this. excellent job with bringing out the detail in all the hubcaps.
9shtudfgje,12500,"nice d.o.f. but unsure of the bw, ."
ea1xoi0xs2,12501,"neat contrast, i had the same idea, but passed, good job, ."

ocb9ngla8w,12504,interesting image. like the bw. dont care for the heavy borders.
nlqpxkfdoh,12505,lovely balance of motion and still photography. a clever idea.
go85plm3xm,12506,for me this is just a little to artsie fartsie you are going to have a hard time with traditional dpcrs your colors are quite vivid and bright i will say
dgu9faec16,12507,id rather see some detail better exposure of the coins. still nice though.
u05yi6q0x6,12508,"oh, my.this looks like a scream.just a tad dark but otherwise an excellent capture"
3rq3yc37o4,12509,"nice idea, i wish the image quality was better, ."
rqzvos9kmz,12510,"nice idea and comp, seems a bit noisy, ."
eaji2tzko9,12511,cool. very sharp and nice rich blue.
vplzag89ei,12512,"seems kinda flat, maybe boosting the saturation wouldve helped to make it pop."
vplzag89ei,12513,might benefit from a saturation and contrast boost
hgfrd44shx,12514,i was about to say red wins! but then i saw black had kinda got there first p
6xm66dypyk,12515,lovely very nice and subtle coloring.
yl870sbf6v,12516,i like how the light shines through the slinky.excellent idea well done
e3k62re7qw,12517,imo your blur is to heavy handed.mind you i like blur for sure but it is almost to much.nice picture although
vrcfvhg4mm,12518,an instance where over exposure does its job. well done.
h3qo9edf8z,12519,its a bit grainy and the compositions not impactful enough.
qm92u53wdb,12520,"first impressions are that it seem a tiny bit over sharpened. the colours are coming from i presume oxidation? with the saturation boost that you did, they are almost too full of colour, the reds seem a little overblown."
kpv2mnxz0r,12521,"hey, its a carnival of color!"
gx3qv6bfsu,12522,lovely happy picture. maybe evening out the children would have worked more balanced but nice colours and smiles!
lhlbe2ijmz,12523,"great textures in this photo, and excellent color and exposure as well."
lhlbe2ijmz,12524,"oh wow, thats sharp, nice colors but not so catchy."
q8goieav13,12525,sharp and good gradation from black to white.
4a1m6bcn2j,12526,love the colors. works well as a silhouete.
37qhgsgwuc,12527,good capture seems a little bright on my monitor though.
x4ycbkxta2,12528,"kind of creepy, but good colors!"
9osxyj25lo,12529,"lol my gosh, what a hoot. fun work, good humor and nice color. kee"
ge4ghoia76,12530,"very nicely framed, great detail, superb exposure. well done."
hfr9cxj2h2,12531,"good idea for the contest, but overly dark on my screen."
l7ujtz1cv9,12532,a good idea. photo would have been more effective fi it had less compression artifacts in it.
l7ujtz1cv9,12533,"sorry, but this is fuzzy. i know action shots take practice i need it myself. so keep practicing!"
l7ujtz1cv9,12534,"shame about the pixelated look, but nice."
1g9q8jlqat,12535,i love the feeling of movement and the colors are great.nice job
1g9q8jlqat,12536,i hope this wins. the motion and stillness of this photo is incredible.the sharpness of every detail is wonderful. i hope this wins this week because i think its perfect!
u8m1deuebh,12537,"great use of light, everything needed is nicely lit and shadows still exist to show time of day."
84hwr4rle6,12538,she is thin! yikes.and also very blue. ltggt nice work and colorful too. kee
e8i3imgr72,12539,"not too much detail exists, seems very blurry."
e8i3imgr72,12540,"nice, but im confused, wich is then and wich now? another thing, is the picture a bit blurry?"
rb8xhk9i0f,12541,"look son, all the light touches will be yours. nice."
7t0bcv38jx,12542,not sharp. good mood. weird light.
ny11i38ds2,12543,"did you have trouble with the sampling? either way, i like this. a lot of detail and many things to see. great job."
ny11i38ds2,12544,"nice pic.did you have a grad filter on though? or was it just the lightning? still, nice picture."
wr7sv0d3p2,12545,"great colors, scary but true message"
wr7sv0d3p2,12546,koolaid in a syringe? normally id say where is the life? but i can see it implied in this photo. the muliple colors are a little weird but a nice touch.
wr7sv0d3p2,12547,"what a visual! would of liked it better with just three odd number syringes but the colors are super. maybe a tad bit dark. nicely done, good job. kee"
wr7sv0d3p2,12548,"artistic, interesting. bright colors. pretty good"
wr7sv0d3p2,12549,"sadly, this is what a lot of the cities have turned to. great color and clarity"
npww6vodqi,12550,i like the sombre mood this evokes.and the feeling of things going on that we cant see.its growing on me!
2qrc5p95mn,12551,"nice lines. a bit fuzzy. its lacking something, but im not sure what. maybe brighter cars could have helped."
0dvtcxliho,12552,"seems a bit grainy for color, nice image though"
43duivoa69,12553,very excellent picture. the only thing that stops me from giving it a is some .jpg or sharpening artifacts.
43duivoa69,12554,i like the idea.lighting is a little harsh and the image is blurred. why bw? i would think the colors would be an asset here.
xgr1c9f1me,12555,this is excellent. i love the graphic design quality. would be really cool if there was one person on one of the balconies although i dont think you had a choice.
xgr1c9f1me,12556,love the colors. quality seems to have been lost somewhere along the line compression maybe?
15b4aatejo,12557,nice day for portland.look at all the green on the bricks.
4nltgjnyn1,12558,"very pretty mood piece. i think i like it in bw better than i would in color. to my mind, you fulfill the challange well with this piece."
oxj4i05999,12559,homeless? needs a little sharpen filter. interesting idea.
fgaast9ge6,12560,"yes, lots of folks out having a good time on a windy day. nice colors. kee"
vmgse143og,12561,"the colors are really muted. was it a hazy day? in my limited knowledge, there are filters that help correct for that for some cameras of course i cant find them for mine. playing with the saturation levels may help too."
94sryndpqd,12562,"this is neat. hard to capture, too. very news magazinelike."
94sryndpqd,12563,"i really like the feeling that this picture gives, its dark and grainy . in one image i understand his thoughts."
94sryndpqd,12564,i like the grainyness intentional or not. good photo
jrj9if97xp,12565,wish i had one of those signs. great image quality
itr3okksrs,12566,i dont quite know what i am looking at but it looks great. too much jpeg compression?
1kqqc5vbxx,12567,"a little static, but nice. good control of exposure and white balance."
1kqqc5vbxx,12568,great quality. messageless.
fh3vayv9z2,12569,"this is nice, but would be nicer if there wasnt so much jpeg compression."
fh3vayv9z2,12570,beautiful image it needs a little extra sharpness. jmsetzler
fh3vayv9z2,12571,i think this is great. i like the little blurring here and there. very colorful. terrific!
zb8x8ndt72,12572,"like the perspectivecontrast between above and below dark and grainy though, lacks definition"
4q053ginkt,12573,"love this! if you increased the contrast, the photo would be much nicer. in black and white photography.your blacks should be black and your whites shold be white. this is all grey tones rigt now."
4q053ginkt,12574,"i love the look of that grandpa, i wish i had one of those. what a great short. it is sharp where it needs to be, the only issue is, is the black and white overkill, or as a colour did it not work?"
sffnh1e9kv,12575,"the morning light isnt bad. it isnt spectacular, but i dont think its hurting the picture. maybe just a bit more contrast. id have to see it."
bynfxb1xoj,12576,"nice photo.i like the motion blur, and the colors."
z2aayvbtec,12577,good capture of colour and light.
xkwjshu0kb,12578,colors and contrast needs work to make the image brighter and pop.
xkwjshu0kb,12579,im not too keen on the purple tintcast that you have going on.
u7853vscfg,12580,i like the mood of the person. nice capture
u7853vscfg,12581,haha i like how their model looks kinda like ur model. the pigeons are a nice touch. the picture seems very noisy though and not extremely visually appealing
7aetvlozt4,12582,this is a great candid! maybe a little more contrast would bring out the kids and the buildings a little more and give it more punch.
o2wj4v36e3,12583,"contrast could help this a lot, blacks black and whites white."
1hwijwbai9,12584,grainy can be good. too much grainy not so good.
1hwijwbai9,12585,i like the idea but the image is of poor quality.
1hwijwbai9,12586,"your sharpening has gone way too far. what a pity, i like the imagery"
1hwijwbai9,12587,there is an incredible amount of pixelation here. not to mention that the contrast between rich and poor is not shown clearly.
1hwijwbai9,12588,"wow, thats some serious balloonage! the pixelation is horrible though"
1hwijwbai9,12589,ugh. too much jpeg compression? this looks very pixelated.
1hwijwbai9,12590,this picture is suffering from horrible jpeg compression. it probably would have been a great pic if this would have been corrected.
bhr1ct8phn,12591,"nice capture! i hope you took this with your telephoto! lmao, looks hot. i know we like to get into our photography a little to much at times. im happy you didnt decide to this time, lol"
eayt3ljqv6,12592,"hooray, a nice and colorful and daytime image for a change."
79t9n35uaa,12593,love the color tones of this pic and the mood it conveys.
2urw85s119,12594,"the exposure on the building is very good, but the skaters seem too overexposed to me. not sure if how you could expose both properly at the same time."
7o1i1qiboi,12595,"i have no idea why this appeals to me, maybe its the implied movement, maybe its how early morning commuters see the world at .am. dunno. i gave it"
7o1i1qiboi,12596,this is pretty cool.i like how all the colors kind of blur together. maybe a little too much blur goin on though
9epv5do0h2,12597,this is so close to being a great picture. its a little too dark for my tastes but im not sure whether to blame that on the picture or my monitor! good capture anyway.
i25ztd280m,12598,a nice photograph. i wonder if a bit more contrast would have made this better. i see too much of a neutral grey which lessens its impact.
i25ztd280m,12599,i for one love good use of blur and i like it here. actually more auto activity might have even been better. nice job.
te5m1udvez,12600,this is a wonderful image but far too contrasty imo
te5m1udvez,12601,brilliant.the contrast between haves and have nots clearly comes thru in bw.
te5m1udvez,12602,nice capture. a bit too contrasty and harsh for me. there needs to be more shadow and highlight detail instead of this extreme black and white. this is especially true for the mans facehis features are nearly obliterated by shadow.
qidhs9txld,12603,i cant see anything other than windows and noise.
33izj7yftd,12604,very clever use of color. this really makes the red stand out. there are not too many of those cars actually moving forward are there! hehe
33izj7yftd,12605,i absolutely love the selective desat. used in this image. the tones in general a so nice.very nice.
33izj7yftd,12606,interesting use of selective desaturation. nice work.
33izj7yftd,12607,"haha, clever! im in this type of red light district five days a week."
33izj7yftd,12608,if only the traffic lights were red too i like this a lot
9eemrtj2gq,12609,other wise vivid bright clear and all around a good picture!
nmqkv3mdzl,12610,love the sepia and the character of this photo. really captured life
2mojre3cbv,12611,great light effects in the subway.
pgph3wieti,12612,neat and clean but also a little yellowish and bland
x6tnv3vz1z,12613,best of the comp so far imo. great tones and colors
ez4p6aivff,12614,"very cool! i love all the different modes of transportation goin on here, great for black and white. nicely done!"
zhyoala3fh,12615,"id love to know how you got such a good, quick exposure in such darkness without a flash!"
cfyikdig5o,12616,"i like the colors in your photo, but it is all still a bit dark to understand the meaning you are trying to convey."
cfyikdig5o,12617,way too dark. i guess theres a photographer in the picture somewhere. ill just have to take your word for it.
buoi9oqb70,12618,"a little bit of a color cast, but nice picture otherwise."
2dvjcq388k,12619,good use of shadows? yes. the add to the dark nature of the image.
2dvjcq388k,12620,a bit sharp but awesome pic
iw88b78q4d,12621,unfortunately places like this do exist. you have captured the mood and essence of the neighbourhood.
ux9fytzp2n,12622,if only there was a red rider bbgun in there.
4mmdcw9ig6,12623,it looks quite hot for january.
kl9uq6l14s,12624,a well done black and white. perfect amount of contrast and wonderful tones. great capture!
u9js3eea0g,12625,i love the sharp lines in this and the lovely colors of the buildings behind. fantastic capture!
u9js3eea0g,12626,"a bit of a mess with all those lines, but it gives the photo some character. even the photo feels scandinavian. nice work."
4gqmdfqrfy,12627,i think the big blue one has spoiled a really topimage . can u ask them to turn it off next time?
4gqmdfqrfy,12628,that blue light ruins this image imo.
qw76acvjhv,12629,what an amazing sculpturefountain as you have certainly captured the richness and detail. i am quite moved by this image.
q3t4wimim5,12630,wow. what a punch of color. nice.
dsniipcz56,12631,i think black and white was a very good choice for this picture.
dsniipcz56,12632,like the black and white. like the hustle and bustle feel of the pic
0ts8vt6i7m,12633,the silvery grey tone work well in this image.
gihk5z5haj,12634,"great photo. nice balance. i like the that it is a little underexposed, the shadow creates great negative highlight. very photojournalistic."
gihk5z5haj,12635,"wonderfull comentary photo, but it needs more contrast."
wzwqepthk1,12636,the grain could have been a little overdone. cocept is good though.
wzwqepthk1,12637,the added grain and darkness detracts from the image. i dont think the strokeframe helps.
59abeie18d,12638,ahh i cant take any more of these kinds of bright lights shots. nextime try for something more unique
1ofc6nrzu6,12639,"hi. what is he encumbered by, besides his thoughts? desat was a good choice, imo."
ff6q58frf7,12640,"colour color is a bit grey. this can be good, if intentional, but i feel it may have more to do with exposure."
ff6q58frf7,12641,"nice idea, too bad its so gray. nothing that really stands out."
ff6q58frf7,12642,"uh isnt he going the wrong way? nice capture, but there is a color cast that is not allowing the real colors to pop."
ff6q58frf7,12643,good idea is itas grey there as your image shows ?
ff6q58frf7,12644,"great idea, but the image looks like the whitepoint has been dragged waay to far down, everything is somewhere between black and gray"
u812c3gelw,12645,not sure if i like the mood with the use of grain?
u812c3gelw,12646,"very nice, i like the use of grain and bw, really give it that mundane activity look."
u812c3gelw,12647,"ohh how entertaining public transportation can be! i kind of like the image grain here. did u add that in? either way, it works.nice black and white"
u812c3gelw,12648,i like how the photo has a sort of texture
2vs0a2f32z,12649,nice colors and archictecture. what is the loose brickstone all about?
2vs0a2f32z,12650,the leading lines are great. the vivid color variations makes it interesting to look all the way down.
9djumbumjv,12651,"slightly grainy, but the colourless picture captures what a grey event the sales are"
9djumbumjv,12652,sepia tone works so well with this photo! gives it an older feel to the image.
481e48hoem,12653,beautiful! great color and exposure. nothing negative to say at all.
481e48hoem,12654,very interesting photo. nice use of colors
481e48hoem,12655,"nice lights and color. the blue is overdone, but i still like it a lot."
481e48hoem,12656,beautiful! i love the contrast bw the blue and the red. great work!
jzur98casv,12657,nice slight motion blur and good exposure of the lights
jzur98casv,12658,nice colors and movement. good job singling out the still one.
jzur98casv,12659,great colours and i like the bluf effect to show busy movement while the lights and buildings show the stillness.
jzur98casv,12660,awesome blur. great capture of the lights. very cityinthewinterlike.
jzur98casv,12661,"im really diggin the motion blur, and those blue lights.just really nicely seen."
jzur98casv,12662,oohh! very nice. i like the super crips exposure of the lights and the mostly blurred skaters. this is very magical looking. i really like it.
6kpvvpvulh,12663,"a great portrait! not very cityish, though, but i think youll do very well by the quality alone."
k0v07njp3q,12664,"looks like you tried this handheld. if you were trying to express motion, i dont think it works too well in this picture imo."
k0v07njp3q,12665,this picture would really look nice with a different white balance and if the buildings werent blurry.
idtdq148i6,12666,nice bw. lacks crispness or clarity.
uezbbl3zai,12667,great image with the unfortunately available light.
i5nuu4ijsj,12668,very nice assortment of colors
0vqxu2imh8,12669,classic portrait.so natural.wonderful
c1obponyyb,12670,nice idea i just wish it was bigger. it seems a bit grainy and the green cast to the image isnt doing it any favors
zfeu2otdp2,12671,"so well to capture it without those movin thingies and with perfect colors, mustve been hard in a cloudy darky day. really, im impressed. great! !"
k5ru1wr85b,12672,like the light look like stars. adds to the picture like it alot ! nice pic
tg6bjg1ufp,12673,"very nice, exposure is perfect. very tough task."
vwlwozpc78,12674,"shocking pink color with the red, but a good image all the same."
exbuotzt1o,12675,exposure seems a little off and theres a heavy gray color cast
r7g6f1pumk,12676,a very god capture with impressive detail and exceptional texture.
ypo1drziwy,12677,now this is christmas ! awesome and loving the bw. the heavy shadow is my only issue. maybe earlier or later in the day would fix that. very nice !
13dly4sl1w,12678,"a little too literal in the rendition to convey any mood to me. i wish i could see all of the wings, also"
ghpf8rakg2,12679,i like the warmth of this one. did you notice your self portrait in the ornaments at the bottom?
0st8wlhfq1,12680,very nice holiday light capture. well done
jmsc34q32n,12681,awesome and certainly inviting the senses to participte in this glorious display of color magic.
jmsc34q32n,12682,"nice offthewall light setup here, lol"
fdjbqq4qno,12683,there is a softness here that is kind of nice. the colors work very well together in a way that says class. i dont care for borders though.
ys3kr4f6di,12684,nice symmetery and colors.
negi11olzk,12685,superb tone detail with simplistic beauty!
h0ng9m7tgp,12686,dont like the overexposure on that otherwise ok lit portrait.
h0ng9m7tgp,12687,nothing says class like bright red vinyl d
suhwj8bu04,12688,"really nice colors, but i think it has been softened a little too much. good work."
gby7pbdzqf,12689,the soft glow you gave this image just makes it! pure class and classic.
i12o44jy76,12690,almost like a christmas abdtraction with lovely hints of things not seen. the colors are very moving.
u7kvwqwbz7,12691,"great capture, cool idea, very nice use of the saturation."
o99cs00rdy,12692,lost a little sharpness in the upload?
mgixbld11l,12693,"great idea, something different, too bad you didnt get it more opened nice colors, ."
mgixbld11l,12694,"lovely colors, great capture, nice creativity."
2lyc0i6k8r,12695,"lovely skyline,cool idea. great capture. colors seem a little muted though."
pxqhdn1qxz,12696,the motion blur detracts from what otherwise could have been a really nice photo.
rd86ighazv,12697,the motion of the latch really shows closing. great.
yrddhqdd6d,12698,spooky and ghostly! super image and wonderful idea. love the blue shadows especially.
tz67hswgn9,12699,some edges are a little unsharp. also the colors are a little dull.
3qcmney6qi,12700,"this is almost perfect, but the solid bands of color looks like you pushed the saturation just a little too far."
7xqzz7arbx,12701,i like the image. i like the colors. it seems a little off kilter imo. still giving it a
7xqzz7arbx,12702,"not sure about the blue tint, was the white balance off or was this the intended effect?"
zug86kfeez,12703,"well done on your blue, must of been a real surprise to you!"
ogjz9dejnp,12704,"though red and orange are somewhat dissonant, i love the colors and lines on this photo."
ogjz9dejnp,12705,i like the vivid color contrasts especially her blue socks and pink shoes.
orbzj1crel,12706,poor image quality blurry. unable to determine what object is ?
0ts2mz08qv,12707,just found this one. gorgeous colour and great clouds.
5uq3wzs3go,12708,"beautiful, soft, colourful but not comiclike. wd on hm"
5uq3wzs3go,12709,i love the mood of this picture and there are clouds too. beautiful
8ts53apyz6,12710,great take and nicely framed. a blue contender for sure!
8ts53apyz6,12711,"amazing! great balance, details, and exposure."
8ts53apyz6,12712,yowza! thats amazing. i love how the lightning is mirrored by the opposite black of the trees branches. the oppose and balance one other nicely.
sziosjq2sb,12713,"nice photo, maybe try a little less on the saturation next time"
sziosjq2sb,12714,"i like this, except the colours are a bit too artificial for my taste."
ad2tj574kj,12715,the lines are a bit jagged oversharpened? but wonderful tones and shapes.
oomyv7myri,12716,"lovely mood created here with the clouds, shadows and light"
1ivb708314,12717,"you caught some pretty cloud formations, and enhanced it with nice color."
ocsw6ubx2x,12718,good job with the color and comp
pzxz0bfuwx,12719,lol i get it! humm bet i know who this one is. i like it espically the big mean clouds against the soft swooshy ones.
pzxz0bfuwx,12720,this has the potential to be really nice. i just think it was too overprocessed. the two different clouds compliment each other well the the antenna is a great accent.
c2itf14k7o,12721,turner in bw. nice!
pukdxwxzpd,12722,bonus of some light on the rocks.
lmgwovyhne,12723,like the colors and silhouetted trees which together have a peaceful effect.
5bgfqfbuuf,12724,nice balance and contrast of colors.
2uugzlae18,12725,"its not the motion of the birds. its the suggestion of motion, mirrored in the clouds."
8mqnst3acs,12726,"looks like shes praying, i like the movement and the colors , nice one"
u1it4rdin6,12727,"the somber feel of your picture seems to emphasize the importance of the red light. maybe thats the other way around. either way, its a good picture"
0wvr7w1wbt,12728,"great portrait sad, confused, dark."
3yqquovymp,12729,cool clown in action. good coloring.
hm6fghjjau,12730,interesting. i would have liked to have seen a bit less movement blur.
54jpqujhbz,12731,"very scary, it works well i love the bright colours of the clown"
fkluz68gkz,12732,hes a norwegian blue p
f1fa8efz03,12733,full marks for a unique take on clowns.
s3e6b33iyy,12734,love the mood of the pic. brilliant!
yg11bq9h0t,12735,doesnt work for clowns and a little overexposed
8mzdfzmkgp,12736,. whats the papery white stuff?
8mzdfzmkgp,12737,"nice use of shadow and light, im not sure what the meaning of this photo is supposed to be, it leaves me a bit confused"
zoh809qvqo,12738,"not quite sharp enough for me i think the light is too harsh, a more natural light may have worked better."
jh4175ecd2,12739,this one is great. bold colors and nice clear details.
d5u6yq3xtf,12740,i really like how colorful your picture is! this is what i think of when i think of a clown! good job!
d5u6yq3xtf,12741,"fun, bright, colourful, just the way a clown photo should be."
d5u6yq3xtf,12742,great portrait.good use of colour.
49omxnudlf,12743,"cool look, harsh light, wish i could explain that better. if i could my own stuff would probably be better."
qs7tp0cyez,12744,another unique idea yay! bright and colorful.
bs11p4z134,12745,i am not sure if black and white is the best choice here.
x0n65zxvkm,12746,"i like it. probably a tad too dark for the average dpcvoter, but i think it helps creating the atnmosphere in this pic."
x0n65zxvkm,12747,love the artful approach. nice use of light and shadow.
erl8958msf,12748,"hehe, thats cute. the shadow detracts from the photo."
bil6f1zzix,12749,"nice colors, nice pose, slightly fuzzy though."
jowr87fqmo,12750,i thinks its a little dark and blurry.
jowr87fqmo,12751,a bit of extra darkness in the picture. probably some more contrast would have helped !
0ycvbw54wr,12752,"interesting, bw for a clown."
9dbtxt8prj,12753,i like the livid colors here and the idea of a crying clown.not all clowns are happy!
rpoeglzu4o,12754,"youve got great detail, but your highlights are blown making your beans very flat in tone"
xu9i30v2sd,12755,great colors and capture. kind of reminds me of
xu9i30v2sd,12756,"good candid capture, lovely colors."
76jhg7ofef,12757,mm. wow. that picture is so warm! nice.
0ccqw6fkrm,12758,the only companion in the darkest of moments
tz3mfnki90,12759,"to me the colors in this seem dullflat.not saying its a bad picture, would just like to see a little more vibrancy"
sxdcl8wl3s,12760,"aw heck, colour coordinated and all."
ca9n61h40n,12761,i think the reds did you in this time. excellent image. if it were bw.
38zsh3gnbg,12762,nice clean black surface.not easy to get in basic editing
gz0i52yrd6,12763,colorful and enjoyable photo.
erww5oz1sv,12764,fun play of light and shadow
r2n143c0hz,12765,"good clarity and detail, just a touch of noise.but not bad"
n7nynx89z0,12766,"very cute. a bit dark though. this picture could do with a little more lightness and contrast, i think."
jec67go2kv,12767,oh my goodness. were you trying to get a blurry look? the color is also off.
r9op0urcrd,12768,interesting picture. puts a new twist on this instrument. like all the blue tones.
76qg7cmm4n,12769,this is a very cool idea. too bad it isnt sharp. handheldlowlight is tough.
76qg7cmm4n,12770,cool idea but would have to be alot sharper in my opinion.
e2clsvpaa8,12771,good use of black and white and motion blur
9kpvsj7cez,12772,"i like the light and the colors alot, well framed and i find harmony in it."
t5cx0gmkx3,12773,never thought of using neat image in this kind of application.
t5cx0gmkx3,12774,"i like the polished, industrial look, but something about this image make it look artificial. too much sharpening or neatimage perhaps?"
t5cx0gmkx3,12775,"great picture, i love the effect of the light, good harmony."
12couposfa,12776,the brown hues makes it a bit fuzzy and uninteresting to look at.
hlmo13xysg,12777,"lovely, lovely lines and curves! wonder what it would look like in bw?"
ys9l0ehauh,12778,too much noise and the white balance of this image is off. nice try though
ys9l0ehauh,12779,there is a lot of noise in the image. not very appealing. nice try.
2ixg42csml,12780,which one of these are not like the others? great job. love the soft lightingfocus and think this was very well done.
j9o6587nak,12781,necessary for diggin into that fresh hot java!
ox6bcmuv27,12782,wow! this was a surprise i didnt see coming! wonderful vibrant colors nice job!
zlvr6pgmi9,12783,"interesting setup and pov. a bit dark, or muddy at least.maybe a slight boost in contrast? i like the grain."
glhhnvotr3,12784,"there appears to be a great deal of light reflecting off of the beans, which serves to wash out those lovely browns in the picture."
3728w2l9kn,12785,i like the setup. the graytones are greate and good contrast. i like this one!
y9onlx3f3b,12786,liked the texture of the beans.but couldve done something to make the picture more unique
yu5wj8m9n7,12787,"beautiful! the light, the tones, the blur of her head.all perfection! very well done."
yu5wj8m9n7,12788,"i like the movement, a nice touch considering the fast pace of coffeeshops."
yu5wj8m9n7,12789,"nice motion blur, although it doesnt do her looks any favors"
1pooeua84y,12790,i like the warm sepia feel with the frenchlike atmospherenostalgic
chfunx6pb4,12791,"here i think the noise works, fits well with the imagery you are going for. good job."
chfunx6pb4,12792,theres something to this image but i cant really figure it out. could be the grain or just that it isnt very polished.
chfunx6pb4,12793,wow this is extremely dramatic. there is so much detail in this picture i could stare at it for a while and find new things about it. awesome awesome job!
g3vz2k13fa,12794,"this has such a fantastic graphic quality about.bold, bright.nicely done."
9f6d16d9am,12795,i really like this idea. i just wish it wasnt quite so blown out in the whites. a little sharper would have helped too.
tefj1ulyfy,12796,good old tims. there seems to be a lot of noise in the photo.
zrotcfvfql,12797,i like the natural splash the picture conveyed! hope this gets the blue!
zrotcfvfql,12798,"great comp. the colour of the broth is not what i personally find appealing, but i adore the way youve lit and especially framed it!"
i4qor7ke1f,12799,"looks yummy great colors and exposure, i really like it. hope you do well."
mrfi2p5iup,12800,yumm.too bad its in black and white
mrfi2p5iup,12801,i would love to see this in color. the bw does not do this picture justice.
kahevzuxlc,12802,"looks like you should have used another, dimmer, light source than your flash."
7qobbodej2,12803,nice colours and textures. love the light effect
rwcbngnfla,12804,"the beans have quite a bit of light reflecting off of them, washing out those lovely browns and blues."
6ky20k8f1q,12805,"i like the black and white approach, it doesnt look as messy that way."
6ky20k8f1q,12806,lightingshadows are a bit harsh for my tastes. you might try diffusing the light or bouncing it off of a white piece of foamcore or something.
2ilthu82wf,12807,really cool idea just a touch more light from above and this is a a much stronger photo for me i love the graphicabstract nature of it great work!
fht4gbslg9,12808,"i like it. nice contrast, sharpness, color."
prqd3tuf7g,12809,"congrat on your rd, i like this photo very much, so natural and spontant and the brown dual tone is great and the contrast very good"
fj7jt7imdl,12810,i love the feeling captured here. candid. makes you want to know whats going on there. the bw was an excellent choice as i guess the posters would have just led to a cacophany of color.
fj7jt7imdl,12811,"like this a lot compositionwise, sepia effect and so on. pity the quality seems rather questionable."
0u9g1fjv6a,12812,.wow.this makes for a really cool abstract.love the light in this image.
0u9g1fjv6a,12813,"the shadow detracts from this photo. great and original idea, though"
c5rhv131rt,12814,"dont love the ligthing, seems a bit unnatural and flat"
40azjpdcja,12815,nice use of black and whiteit works well.
y4xgyqc6sv,12816,its a nescafe moment.good job recapturing a classic.
y4xgyqc6sv,12817,"kind of dark on my monitor, too bad, i really like it wish there was more detail in the beans more light."
3a0m28fwbt,12818,"i also wonder how this photo would look in bw, with its rich variations in grays."
ybtjxmlssn,12819,the tones sharpness and detail in amazing. i gave this a seven! exposure is dead on.
9j5xzjp27e,12820,i loovve the coloring of the glaciers.beautiful
lynsifbj1w,12821,this is all the way pro quality. call budweiser asap.
lynsifbj1w,12822,"to my mind this picture represented cold more than any other. it is also a clear, sharp image and i like the idea. great photo."
v79ygxoqf7,12823,"wow noticed this as your avatar, but definitely wasnt thinking cold. seems more hot to me. no offense, just being honest"
v79ygxoqf7,12824,now thats cold. pure genious.
7v9ms4yirj,12825,rina you are hot! this is a fabulous portrait
7v9ms4yirj,12826,i love the magical qualities of this. the blue tone and sparkles really do a nice job of creating that cool feeling.
bzj0mziinj,12827,well i think this should have been in first place but hey at least you got a red. great work.
59vs54p47g,12828,i think the front is a bit to dark. but it is an very nice picture! i wish i had something like this nearby.
s93b3gi1a5,12829,great job with the colour underneath.
ndv3wwwb0m,12830,im very curious how you made this photo. nice colors and light!
bogry1bevg,12831,f word being flat. lol thought i would include that.
bogry1bevg,12832,nice detail and soft color.great comp.
zfdwfdci8e,12833,great concecpt.i like the yellow tones and gritty feel
zfdwfdci8e,12834,original and neat orange color.
jcu18c4m6b,12835,gorgeous! the blue tones add a definite chill to the photo
ew3k2krna5,12836,super! great idea and nice colors! my complements.
c8dla7c8w9,12837,doesnt pop quite as much as it should i think has an under exposed look. i have a bit of a hard time with the white line running through the lettering.
9cz5wb1kbw,12838,"looks kind of sad, like the little green bits died reaching out for help."
23d7k2f4ba,12839,picture is a bit to dark. i think if you had a flash from behind the image it would be better. more catchy than it is now.
8pwkz60l2x,12840,great glow and nice detail.
y8krmvlojy,12841,"it took me a second, but.freezerpops! i prefer blue, for the record."
2fgxyk1wms,12842,i felt the image a was too dark and somewaht grainy.
2fgxyk1wms,12843,effect of the grain is overwhelming.
2fgxyk1wms,12844,"interesting image, but the graininess doesnt work for me."
2fgxyk1wms,12845,the photo is a bit blurry. not sharp enough. outherwise it is a very nice photo
yq91izz7vv,12846,the photo is lovely but there are too many warm colors that dont associate with coldness
3bcc13o7yf,12847,i like it for the quirkiness. odd and yet fun.
39c6gu3388,12848,"a cute pic, but comes off a little flat looking to me. i copied it into paintshop pro to see, and i found some modest curves, saturation contrast adjustments really gave this some nice pop."
98g6tt44qz,12849,excellent! nearly hdr! great work!
9cdjl77sv5,12850,"very cold. at first glance i thought it was black and white, but i like the green in there giving it another dimention."
0ngglcie9x,12851,"yeah, that was the first thing i noticed at rollover was that you finished just ahead of me.i must be through with my hot streak.lol.baseballs really arent supposed to be covered with snow.trees are.i get it now."
atu71vxuwg,12852,i suspect the younger ones and those that live in a warm climate wont get it. here in england i remember some bitterly cold baths in the s and s.
xae1yy0wer,12853,clever idea! wondering if color wouldnt have been more effective though.
xae1yy0wer,12854,very clever! that must have taken a bit of work and planning. nicely done in the bw
tmvypfkgv5,12855,white balance looks too blue to me
rg60tp7t15,12856,"lovely colours, perhaps very slightly too much saturation though, especially the legs."
c4lwajwtr9,12857,sweet dances of light in this.
692cd248hl,12858,interesting contrast of imagery. excellent pp.
csbrrqor2j,12859,"wish it was sharper, i think with the cold look a more blue white balance would have looked better."
1s3eteldwt,12860,its perfect! my choice for a blue!
i3u041o01q,12861,brr indeed. monochromatic color scheme works perfectly for this.
h4df8k18f2,12862,"a bit contrasty but certainly shows cold, good photo."
rt2t0smgpz,12863,"cute collection. the light seems too bright, washing out some of the details on the figures."
3n52zzqcs4,12864,"a well kept collection over the years, very nice, colors are neat."
3n52zzqcs4,12865,reminds me a little of those ispy books. just seems a tad dark. could just be my monitor though. i like it. i gave .
jslv5ue1xf,12866,"bright, colorful and fun image!"
jslv5ue1xf,12867,a bit too bright. some of the toys are hard to see.
em36bj1leu,12868,a little too dark and fuzzy for my taste.
sv57nit3dx,12869,"i normally love black and white, but santa,old or new, really needs color. i think it would have a stronger impact."
qgviswu9f5,12870,id love to see this as a bw with those great lines and tone variations!
21da94awwi,12871,"great! i never could take a good picture of spheres. amazing contrast you have here, i think its what makes it so interesting."
in3bkzynn2,12872,"cute, and great arrangement and colors. but why not submit a bigger image i want more pixels."
la98tdat10,12873,seems a little blurred to me. i think it could be stronger by reducing the number of elements heads.
la98tdat10,12874,nice idea but too bad its blurry
emszkzwbpc,12875,creepy! like the touch of green standing out. the bugs just look a little too artficial but you couldnt help that i guess
ur2f1701o3,12876,"the colour is very vibrant, the red and white stands out really well."
6hoc9gzhf8,12877,"very well lit, and neat lineperspective."
3sypl01j7s,12878,"greattitle, but slightly odd picture."
74nxijuroe,12879,great harmony of colors.

4638op0dbd,12881,"good lightning but a little collection, dont u have more?"
11bpz192kk,12882,"this is lovely and such a wonderful soft suttle image, well done"
11bpz192kk,12883,"nice collection, if only there was a way to get more color in it."
2a0zt04lj7,12884,good message here and you have taken a great detailed image
sfbbqkomsd,12885,killing joke good taste nice colour!
sfbbqkomsd,12886,very classy.i love how you didnt use actual color because this tone makes it seem older.nice job!
eaba9g3and,12887,"this is nice, but i would have liked it more if the light on the whole pic was even. the bw works well."
s8cn5b8x8j,12888,"looks like a tough place to take photos, you have done a good job of managing the light"
81fj7gd0gl,12889,"first of all, what a cool photo! i always always without a doubt love photos of translucent objects placed on a light source, especially with such cool colors, as in this photo."
81fj7gd0gl,12890,very nice collection. great detail and color.
c6w02hiww7,12891,"a blast of colour, light and shapes. i wasnt quite sure what i was looking at, but studying it got me there."
fp43v2c8to,12892,this is kinda neat. i like the transparent effect. cool. .
fp43v2c8to,12893,i envy your concertgoing experiences! i also love the transparency.
d96v90jckp,12894,such a good ideapity its a bit blurry.
d96v90jckp,12895,not sharp enough for this fun collection.
d96v90jckp,12896,"too much bllury photo. you should be using tripod for this. colors are ok, but texas looks like overexposed"
jei0dnpz3c,12897,"the graininess is great, but the darkness makes it difficult to see the coins detail and makes the shadows overly prominent.imo."
jei0dnpz3c,12898,"im guessing you were aiming for the image grain, but i personally dont care for it in this one."
r2cd3rc8pp,12899,"a little too dark, too much detail is hidden"
jws3jvb6tj,12900,its wel lit and the colours are true. the oncamera flash was hot and has flared on poor old st exupery which will loose you points in this tough school.
jzo0umwioe,12901,"unique collection, seems like a difficult thing to photgraph."
2s1mn2cc6h,12902,"love bears and these are cute, and you have coptured the softness."
iqa1yeyaqx,12903,"picture is a little blurry and might have been more attractive if the colors had been more intense from the caps on all the bottles. however, this is a good collection."
97ldyewvug,12904,"beautiful scultures and colors, might be better with just the colored pieces."
g7ijs0bul4,12905,"with respect to librodo, this should have been the blue! and with yourself as the model! fabulous! congats!"
5tizkg8lxw,12906,this is a very neat collection of army cars.
5tizkg8lxw,12907,too bad the tanks in front are not sharp. still like it.
8qftp9ik1p,12908,"i like the contrast of metals, woods, organics."
c9571kjqe1,12909,great use of colour. very subdued yet very powerful. excellent in all ways.
c9571kjqe1,12910,the desat works very well here to complement the mood created by the facial expressions. a little creepy but effective.
c9571kjqe1,12911,"slightly creepy, yet very interesting. nice colors!"
2jr6mvxgw7,12912,"very clever, great comp exposure"
t5qe6vngjs,12913,"very nice picture, love the colors. nice collection."
0ozlwub9pw,12914,"gorgeously composed. i love the detail and the great old and wornness of them. the light, for me, casts a mood on them that doesnt really fit with the antiqueness of them. something softer maybe. well seen, though."
zu68vlhjpz,12915,"if you are going to do coins, this is a very nice way of doing them. like the sepia tone."
mdpftcqt4g,12916,"i love this picture, you have captured the essence of vendors on ny streets, the bw makes it stand out even more. awsome!"
l002jm5exx,12917,"the photo is quite dark, and its difficult to distinguish much detail as a result."
l002jm5exx,12918,"quite dark, not dark and strange, not dark and mysterious, but dark and why cant i see things. if you were trying for a deeper message, im afraid i didnt get it."
aqpt2lkkd7,12919,beautiful arrangement and the colors really relect in the object very well. good clearity.
o681g8w5ll,12920,"this is a neat idea, but im looking too much at the relection of the light."
zkt3varfxs,12921,wow. great contrast and detail.
tugz1uw18k,12922,almost hypnotic with great color and touchable textures. returning for final bump.
tugz1uw18k,12923,nice! love all the colors and lines. the sharp points really add to it.
uu5igm0hpx,12924,"wow, fantastic color and design. nice detail."
uu5igm0hpx,12925,"ooh, prettily done. gorgeous color saturation."
xyygyuyki3,12926,"great idea. im not sure if the light used was the correct choice, maybe something a little brighter or larger."
wwp9klst63,12927,this could have been an amazing picture if there were more contrast between the butterflies and the leaves.
wwp9klst63,12928,"great capture, but could use some adjustments for color and contrast."
9wt770vwj6,12929,nicely composed. interesting lines. wonder how this would have looked as a bw with all the lines and textures?
gmcifwjjz1,12930,i love the way you have used light in this photo great job
6i0k912lnd,12931,"wow, very nice. i like the ripple reflections, they really add to the picture."
ay1bdvta90,12932,nice arrangement. less warm might be better for brighter color.
an4of5lyow,12933,dolls. unsharp and poor light
7bzikqts8e,12934,"weak, should have done better! i like it, so thats good. p"
7nb1ywwjet,12935,"nice change from the yellow moons, blue diamonds, green clovers etc. well done."
75y52uaxb5,12936,neat colors and i like the randomness. a bump in sat and contrast would help it in my opionion
nut9dzhn9m,12937,very nice and serene. the bottles add a good contrast.
nut9dzhn9m,12938,this picture is so hazy! nice color.
nut9dzhn9m,12939,"beautiful greens here.the bottles break the monotony of only green and add a lot of charachter to this pic, very good!"
bw2lzceqpt,12940,the cars are kind of bland colored and dull. not an extremely interesting photo. not a wow photo.
ouup6isymc,12941,oohh.very impressive. this is one of my faves so far. the colors are so pure.
y1y88m1qni,12942,there seems to be a lot of noise in this picture but still good nonetheless
y1y88m1qni,12943,"i dont like the grainy feel, but nice idea."
4bd92lyn3t,12944,"i know i am slow, but i have to admit i dont see the color or anything that makes me think color sorry."
4bd92lyn3t,12945,i guess black and white are colors too. arent they? but you really gotta clean your shoes
4bd92lyn3t,12946,"i, for one, believe that black and white are colors! and i also think that is is a good image with cool shadows and contrasts."
4bd92lyn3t,12947,"black white are nutrals, brown is the color."
4bd92lyn3t,12948,nice job nice use of color

9i7v88cpfx,12951,interesting abstract.very good capture of color but umm.what is it?
kjlk9zeesx,12952,very nice. exposure is excellent. really good colors.

9854cbjczy,12954,nice job nice use of color
vear6lpu15,12955,image isnt very sharp. that would help also using the levels fiunction in photoshop would help. the image has a yellowish cast to is that can easily be corrected in ps.
vear6lpu15,12956,"very nice pic. you could have put a little more centering on it to help it out but, the coloring is really nice. great imagenation."
ahg5dzm58g,12957,"make it brighter, i think. there seems to be a little noise in the c."
nqnsfq94pf,12958,"this is a nice photo, but the color is rather bland and its not creating much wow factor in the image. setzler"
l7hsz25mpr,12959,nice clear image. the image could be more colorful though. i dont consider white to be very colorful. but nice job.
l7hsz25mpr,12960,too bright. deeper tones would be great!
qir0q0pbn3,12961,these shots usually get better color saturation on rainy days.

x9gdoug0zc,12970,love the varitey of color that is reflecting off these cds. nicely done very unique.
8vizujhx0f,12971,i like how this uses dark rich colors and comes out looking incredible. great work. it shows that colors dont have to be bright to be effective.
8vizujhx0f,12972,"beautiful macro, the blue and purple main colors complement each other very well."
d3axkxqyue,12973,i just love all the the photos accenting one hue.lots of shades of green displayed here.

goe1acjmpc,12979,"it meets the topical requirements, but is otherwise too ambiguous doesnt add to my knowledge or experience in a significant way."
goe1acjmpc,12980,"i think maybe this was done by swinging some lights around.but what kind of lights, this is very colorful."
25835tauj2,12981,"if i were a teacher, you would get an a. but i am not, so you get a . it may be the way it uploaded, but its a little too red for my taste and almost like a silkscreening."

6lhzr6cwms,13021,i like the over saturated look of the colors. nice lines.
6nulfsxifj,13022,great use of a muted color instead of bright flashing reds and yellows.
7ix3shfnbf,13023,"the highlights deistract. maybe if you could tone those down a little, but otherwise a great pic."

rce1t8c358,13036,"familiar model. lol nice use of green, blue, red but no fair on the cuteness factor."
zdu33zvzm0,13037,this pic is too dark imo i realise its supposed to be partly in shadow but theres too little of the true colour showing through.

h1evqqnq69,13054,good color a real pretty blue
h1evqqnq69,13055,now this is a very different photo. like the dark blue in this black and white image. the blue sets it off rather nicely. great work.
h1evqqnq69,13056,you just gotta love this photo! the blue looks very vivid due to the desaturation of all the other colors. the idea is good and you made the best out of it .
kg8jk5ycar,13057,"bright, vivid color and texture. nicely done!"
kg8jk5ycar,13058,nice idea nice use of color
kg8jk5ycar,13059,nice. you might consider lowering the gamma light a little and boosting the color saturation a bit to increase the intensity and contrast of the colors.
yx4yv51a7p,13060,"i like the mood in this photo. the color is soft, but still stands out. very pretty."

mi5os1wx8g,13067,"cool capture, every color of the spectrum is represented in your photo, well done."
m53mvz9e8q,13068,"excellent setup. i like all the complements except if yellow complements green, how does yellow complement purple? i would have liked it better if red was on blue, blue was on red, yellow was on green, green was on yellow like that"

4uz2vd0z7b,13075,i love the choice of blues im glad you didnt choose the brightest colors available this is a nicer choice and it definitely works with blue on blue.
4uz2vd0z7b,13076,the blue roofs? i think its far too subtle and distant.
e6j41xg5tm,13077,"while white is all colors together, it is really more of a neutral. color is not dominant here"
6903wwjhiz,13078,"i think red, blue, red, blue or vice versa wouldve given a better effect but i like it a lot none the less."
6903wwjhiz,13079,"good pic, could sue some levelsbrightnesscontrast adjsutment to make the color pop more though."

xq3ywfz0x7,13081,well done! a very original and well composed photo. healthy too the colors here are very vibrant. i hope you enjoyed eating it afterwards!
kr4b088224,13082,"for those wondering about saturation and natural colors, there was no saturation or change of colors made."
kr4b088224,13083,"i like red, but this didnt work for me. blue or green maybe."
epcjj8qn1z,13084,"very nice, clouds are great. alot of noise in the pic though. you should try using neat image."
l8oxqmt3ot,13085,the colours here could really have been brought out a little better imo. takes the edge off a nice pic.
98312k594y,13086,this is a very different photograph. very well done. nice pastel colors with a variety of colors. nice.
98312k594y,13087,interesting but not really a whole lot of color. a good idea though
7mabmwbysl,13088,"lol, cute! a little grainy. easily fixable!"
66drcfkt0e,13089,fantastic amount of colors. how would this look with a slight saturation or contrast boost? its so colorful i wish it shined! lol
66drcfkt0e,13090,looks like a painters pallette of colors.
66drcfkt0e,13091,nicely captures color. well composed and good use of light.
w3wq0f3ti1,13092,"could use a little brightening and saturation, nice idea."

b9cd6hmlnv,13101,interesting choice i think your idea had a lot of merit maybe brighter flames on the ones that are dark or darker flames on the ones that are overly bright?
b9cd6hmlnv,13102,"many different shades of yellow represented here, a very serene image i like it good work."
b9cd6hmlnv,13103,nice arragement of candles and variety of colored candles. the red falme sets them all off rather nicely.
b9cd6hmlnv,13104,"good idea. i can barely tell the candles are colored. but you should have lit them from the front so its clear. as it is, the pic isnt very colorful."

ct2payugvi,13142,"stunning find, colors and light.wow this is too cool."
uh2papd7mf,13143,"be nice. its pretty. and i never liked the colour green, anyway."
uh2papd7mf,13144,so many rainbows of crayons and colored pencils this one is better than most.
unay3mdhr2,13145,this has a lot of bright color. i like how the grapes all have a shiny looking effect to them. nice image.
unay3mdhr2,13146,the color is excellent. the clarity isnt really good on the grapes. i like the contrast with the leaves.
pxph0e1lfd,13147,interesting use of saturation and sharpmess. not much contrast. it is hard to make out the flowers.
pxph0e1lfd,13148,"this is a nice photo, but the color is rather bland and its not creating much wow factor in the image. it seems to be a bit overexposed. setzler"
clr0i2ueyc,13149,"yep it is rather devoid of color! although rust is a color too, and you have several tones of brown here."
g6cin0u09a,13150,nice idea nice use of color
0b7mvtuw3a,13151,wow! this is a very interesting capture youve got here. it reminds me of an ad for the cruise line.
q8j2ijpwoc,13152,nice portrait but too grainy for my taste.
iygd27oad7,13153,"there are a lot of colors here ones we all know and love. i think they werent vibrant enough, definitely could have used some postshot adjustments. good choice of colors."
iygd27oad7,13154,"nice idea, but too dark and blurry."
iygd27oad7,13155,if only we had those phsyic powers? your color could use a tad of tweeking.
iygd27oad7,13156,focusl. the colored mm seem to be gouped together. get rid of the broken one.
xb08m2kcy3,13157,"you red headed fuck, i hate you and your worthless photography. and you have anally transmitted stds"

w9lqfyv17k,13160,nice job nice use of color
sn3m83ldj1,13161,"when i think color, the first thing that comes to my mind is something saturated, vivid, hot, and so on. looking at this picture i get a peace and tranquility meaning and it is still very colorful. cold colors. interesting."

ahuv1s5e1a,13163,"clever! color in bw, i like it."

lxgywxsyf8,13167,i think you could expose it a little more. maybe some levels adjustments in photoshop would enhance this picture greatly.

7h2rjy9724,13169,this is a uniqe photo. it has a variety of color. very nice.

r8alym15m7,13182,"i get it. youre saying this life is devoid of color, yes? cool idea!"
r8alym15m7,13183,"so, do you really think that this is all there is to life and color? i hope not. besides its gloomy message, the picture itself doesnt even look like black and white just grayish, murky and grainy. altogether, not terribly exciting, i am sorry to say. ."
r8alym15m7,13184,"unfortunately, i dont understand your interpretation of color setzler"
3tmor7rjm9,13185,"this is a nice photo, but the color is rather bland and its not creating much wow factor in the image. setzler"
yfpagezuum,13186,i like the light and dark contrast. the flowers are very pretty.
yfpagezuum,13187,"the whole picture has a yellowish tint to it. was this intentional? if not, try using levels or curves in your editor to fix it. nice placement of the flowers."

8j9i22pllg,13192,"wow, thats particularly evocative of color. great idea and execution."
tu7g3lq2yt,13193,yes! someone did a color version of this and i was dying to see it done better in bw.
0dsj39fj4j,13194,"very cool image, but it doesnt really convay pink."
h34zo08rbc,13195,"superb sparkle in this image, which somehow gives the feeling of color glow. very well done! ."
h34zo08rbc,13196,"cool picture, but what color does it convay? the closest i could think is blue, but that has nothing to do with replication."
h34zo08rbc,13197,"love the image, but cannot see color in my mind at all."
6vba551qhb,13198,nicely done ringostarr! your detail on your hands is perfect.

uv7009ny77,13201,"lucky they werent black berries, good finish well done."

fy0wbh7pyp,13203,"wonderful, dynamic and colorful picture! well done."
qiz2j95o45,13204,"i like the picture, but is it in black and white? its looks like sepia tones to me."
9elqegapzg,13205,you could really use a contrast boost on this one. its comes off pretty muddy
z1p7cy205h,13206,edit to add i just looked at the downstream thumbs and i retract my second line above.
z1p7cy205h,13207,super sharp and nice angles and leading lines.
vwlqtbk9o6,13208,i wish that the was a bigger differnece in the shades of the colors so that you could tell what the different colors are.
so6y021nhz,13209,so is he screaming the name of the color? i dont get it. great black and white though.
diwad9ume1,13210,"even in bw this is very bright, very bold! and yes, colorful."
k1swu8ebgv,13211,"overblown, causing a little too much softness in your drops"
k1swu8ebgv,13212,are the circles little tomatoes? the backlighting makes it hard to tell.
r56cmhdpoc,13213,"i say its yellow or very light green, but im colorblind, so im used to this kind of mystery p"
syb23ob9rl,13214,eek! that is freaky! good detail in your shot.shivver
3i4hglrix4,13215,"this one is from australia, that is almost for sure the link on the cans. good attempt. not as sharp as it could have been imo."
mzruylw0mc,13216,"for some reason, i see orange and yellow instead of gray. thats wat is the success of this sho, i believe."
mzruylw0mc,13217,very nice photo. imo it appears as this photo is a duotone and not a true black and white photo.
r2o9th2uvb,13218,the final photo must be in black and white and the grays in between. this isnt a bw photo.
kvt4wlg3e4,13219,a clear dmnc. the description clearly states that the photo was to be in bw.
kvt4wlg3e4,13220,the final photo must be in black and white and the grays in between. this isnt a bw photo.
kvt4wlg3e4,13221,this was a black and white contest sorry that you didnt understand. remember next time.
kvt4wlg3e4,13222,"sorry, not a black and white image."
gsb7fy28ix,13223,this confuses me a bit and it doesnt really comunicate color through black and white to me
bgiijc1qef,13224,pretty colors there. yes. i can see them. i wont change a thiing in the picture. except may be add a bit more of light and contrast.
6pd6iec7jn,13225,i think it just needs a curves or levels adjustment to kick the contrast a bit. otherwise it has great detail.
rkzvxthz30,13226,its a soft picture also it is true babies dream in
pbvtfnwa6y,13227,very nice shapes and textures. it screams the orange color.
r0nxeacahm,13228,"although this doesnt scream color to me, it is nonetheless very effective and works beautifully as a black white image."
kwvtgvu7n2,13229,blacker blacks upping the contrast might make everything stand out a bit better.
km5ys2m9tl,13230,this looks great in black and white. im sure it is even more stunning in color. nice work
km5ys2m9tl,13231,"wow, impressive! please provide details on how you did this!"
km5ys2m9tl,13232,id love to see this in a larger format. sure says color to me.
wc7lyvucg5,13233,"i dont physically see color in this one, but the message is terrific and the execution is also."
zun6w3m8n8,13234,"oh, i love this picture! such wondermous joy and delight! and yes, the actual color is irrelevant its the color youve provided to childhood that makes this work. wonderful."
z1v45y8ano,13235,"it doesnt quite convey much colour to me, mainly because we have flowers like this with white blooms"
heoc48d2sh,13236,"i like the peaceful yet lonely feeling here. not sure about it conveying an idea of colour, for me the bw suits the mood here, but i guess id have to see it in colour to make a judgement there."
heoc48d2sh,13237,quiet color for sure. its beautiful.
mk5hn7i1vu,13238,maybe an outtake in color would help
mk5hn7i1vu,13239,yeah i guess maybe there was color in the pic. doesnt communicate them to me.
mk5hn7i1vu,13240,"nice image, good contrast. it doesnt imply one particular color, but does imply there is color there."
yihwtdr9tx,13241,a good choice one doesnt need to know the specific colors to see color here.
9t3ita69aq,13242,lovely photo. but doesnt really impart color
5ktec1u37n,13243,"very well done, though i had preferred not to read the color names on the bottles"
5ktec1u37n,13244,nice! rich blacks and white whites. good comp too.
d7s95qseoz,13245,"i know there should be colors, but i have no idea what colors, so its not really communicating well. sorry. good pic otherwise."
d9de728bi7,13246,a bit too dark and boring. just my opinion.
6ye395pym6,13247,? not sure what this is but its quite blurry and poorly composed and lit
ttn5h321dj,13248,hmm! not sure what color on what color.
ttn5h321dj,13249,i dont see how this meets the color on the same color requirement
kfm3pp49e7,13250,"i simply love this! the textures are especially nice, but then, who can argue with such a beautiful green?"
nl2pgoaaiy,13251,ew! this is an amazing photograph. it really shows all the kind of icky detail.
4ss8mrxt52,13252,definately a greeting cardfeel to this. very delicate and nice detail.
smvklikntd,13253,very nice. im sold she is a smurf. blue is everywere.
5od5ymiaqg,13254,nice and super zesty. appropiate for the hot spell across the usa.
hxu0jqu4cj,13255,"i think, not sure, this is a bit oversharpened. i do like, however, the oversaturation."
zhv1prlfmb,13256,"this is just so senious, and so stunning, in a soft kind of way."
